Download Handouts:

    hw1-1__m101j_m101p_5258458de2d4233537765336.zip

Install MongoDB on your computer and run it on the standard port.

Download the HW1-1 from the Download Handout link and uncompress it.

Use mongorestore to restore the dump into your running mongod. Do this by opening a terminal window (mac) or cmd window (windows) and navigating to the directory so that you are in the parent directory of the dump directory (if you used the default extraction method, it should be hw1/). Now type:

mongorestore dump

Note you will need to have your path setup correctly to find mongorestore.

Next, go into the Mongo shell, perform a findOne on the collection called hw1 in the database m101. That will return one document. Please provide the value corresponding to the "answer" key from the document returned.

hint: if you got back a document that looks like { "_id": 1234, "answer": 2468 }, you would put in 2468 (with no spaces) for your answer. This is not the correct number; you should get a different number.

In this problem, we want to test that you have a working JDK, that maven is installed and that you can run maven-based projects. Please install JDK for Java version 6 or 7, as well as Maven 3.1. If they are not already installed, you can find them in the courseware.

Download hw1-3.zip from Download Handout link, uncompress it, cd into the hw1-3 directory (there should be a pom.xml file in there), and run Maven as follows:

$ mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.mongodb.SparkHomework

It requires Maven to be installed correctly to work. If you run it correctly, you should be able to go to localhost:4567 in your browser, or simply curl it.

If everything is set up correctly, you will see the following:

The answer is:

Type the number that appears after the colon into the box below. No spaces, nothing but digits.
