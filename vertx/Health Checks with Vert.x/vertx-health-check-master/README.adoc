= Vert.x Health Check

This component provides a simple way to expose health checks. Health checks are used to express the current state
of the application in very simple terms: _UP_ or _DOWN_. The health checks can be used individually, or in
combination to Vert.x Web or the event bus.

This component provides a Vert.x Web handler on which you can register procedure testing the health of the application.
The handler computes the final state and returns the result as JSON.
