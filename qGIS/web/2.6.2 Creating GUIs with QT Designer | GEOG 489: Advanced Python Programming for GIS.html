 it’s good and useful to understand how to write Python code to create a
 GUI directly, it’s obviously a very laborious and time consuming 
approach that requires writing a lot of code. So together with the 
advent of early GUI frameworks, people also started to look into more 
visual approaches in which the GUI of a new software application is 
clicked and dragged together from predefined building blocks. The 
typical approach is that first the GUI is created within the graphical 
GUI building tool and then the tool translates the graphical design into
 code of the respective programming language that is then included into 
the main code of the new software application.</p>

<p>The GUI building tool for QT that we are going to use in this lesson 
is called QT Designer. QT Designer is included in the PyQT5 Python 
package. The tool itself is platform and programming language 
independent. Instead of producing code from a particular programming 
language, it creates a .ui file with an xml description of the QT-based 
GUI. This .ui file can then be translated into Python code with the 
pyuic5 GUI compiler tool that also comes with PyQT5. There is also 
support for directly reading the .ui file from Python code in PyQT5 and 
then generate the GUI from its content, but we here will use the 
approach of creating the Python code with pyui5 because it is faster and
 allows us to see and inspect the Python code for our application. 
However, you will see an example of reading in the content of the .ui 
file directly in Lesson 4. In the following, we will take a quick look 
at how the QT Designer works.</p>

<p>Since you already installed PyQt5 from the ArcGIS Pro package 
manager, the QT Designer executable will be in your ArcGIS Pro default 
Python environment folder, either under 
"C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\ESRI\conda\envs\arcgispro-py3-clone\Library\bin\designer.exe"
 or&nbsp;under “C:\Program 
Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\Library\bin\designer.exe”.
 It might be good idea to create a shortcut to this .exe file on your 
desktop for the duration of the course, allowing you to directly start 
the application. After starting, QT Designer will greet you as shown in 
the figure below:</p>

<div class="img-center"><img alt="screenshot of opening view of QT program" src="2.6.2%20Creating%20GUIs%20with%20QT%20Designer%20%7C%20GEOG%20489:%20Advanced%20Python%20Programming%20for%20GIS_arquivos/qtdesigner.jpg"><div class="img-caption">Figure 2.21 QT Designer</div>
</div>

<p>QT Designer allows for creating so-called “forms” which can be the 
GUI for a dialog box, a main window, or just a simple QWidget. Each form
 is saved as a single .ui file. To create a new form, you pick one of 
the templates listed in the “New Form” dialog. Go ahead and double-click
 the “Main Window” template. As a result, you will now see an empty main
 window form in the central area of the QT Designer window.</p>

<div class="img-center"><img alt="see caption" src="2.6.2%20Creating%20GUIs%20with%20QT%20Designer%20%7C%20GEOG%20489:%20Advanced%20Python%20Programming%20for%20GIS_arquivos/emptywindow.jpg"><div class="img-caption">Figure 2.22 Empty form for a new QMainWindow</div>
</div>

<p>Let’s quickly go through the main windows of QT Designer. On the left
 side, you see the “Widget Box” pane that lists all the widgets 
available including layout widgets and spacers. Adding a widget to the 
current form can be done by simply dragging the widget from the pane and
 dropping it somewhere on the form. Go ahead and place a few different 
widgets like push buttons, labels, and line edits somewhere on the main 
window form. When you do a right-click in an empty part of the central 
area of the main window form, you can pick “Lay out” in the context menu
 that pops up to set the layout that should be used to arrange the child
 widgets. Do this and pick “Lay out horizontally” which should result in
 all the widgets you added being arranged in a single row. See what 
happens if you instead change to a grid or vertical layout. You can 
change the layout of any widget that contains other widgets in this way.</p>

<p>On the right side of QT Designer, there are three different panes. 
The one at the top called “Object Inspector” shows you the hierarchy of 
all the widgets of the current form. This currently should show you that
 you have a QMainWindow widget with a QWidget for its central area, 
which in turn has several child widgets, namely the widgets you added to
 it. You can pretty much perform the same set of operations that are 
available when interacting with a widget in the form (like changing its 
layout) with the corresponding entry in the “Object Inspector” 
hierarchy. You can also drag and drop widgets onto entries in the 
hierarchy to add new child widgets to these entries, which can sometimes
 be easier than dropping them on widgets in the form, e.g., when the 
parent widget is rather small.</p>

<p>The “Object” column lists the object name for each widget in the 
hierarchy. This name is important because when turning a GUI form into 
Python code, the object name will become the name of the variable 
containing that widget. So if you need to access the widget from your 
main code, you need to know that name and it’s a good idea to give these
 widgets intuitive names. To change the object name to something that is
 easier to recognize and remember, you can double-click the name to edit
 it, or you can use “Change objectName” from the context menu when you 
right-click on the entry in the hierarchy or the widget itself.</p>

<p>Below the “Object Inspector” window is the “Property Editor”. This 
shows you all the properties of the currently selected widget and allows
 you to change them. The yellow area lists properties that all widgets 
have, while the green and blue areas below it (you may have to scroll 
down to see these) list special properties of that widget class. For 
instance, if you select a push button you added to your main window 
form, you will find a property called “text” in the green area. This 
property specifies the text that will be displayed on the button. Click 
on the “Value” column for that property, enter “Push me”, and see how 
the text displayed on the button in the main window form changes 
accordingly. Some properties can also be change by double-clicking the 
widget in the form. For instance, you can also change the text property 
of a push button or label by double-clicking it.</p>

<p>If you double-click where it says “Type Here” at the top, you can add
 a menu to the menu bar of the main window. Give this a try and call the
 menu “File”.</p>

<div class="img-center"><img alt="see caption. file button highlighted in the top left corner next to type here" src="2.6.2%20Creating%20GUIs%20with%20QT%20Designer%20%7C%20GEOG%20489:%20Advanced%20Python%20Programming%20for%20GIS_arquivos/menufile.jpg"><div class="img-caption">Figure 2.23 Adding a File menu to the menu bar by double-clicking on "Type Here"</div>
</div>

<p>The last pane on the right side has three tabs below it. “Resource 
browser” allows for managing additional resources, like files containing
 icons to be used as part of the GUI. “Action editor” allows for 
creating actions for your GUI. Remember that actions are for things that
 can be initiated via different GUI elements. If you click the “New” 
button at the top, a dialog for creating a new action opens up. You can 
just type in “test” for the “Text” property and then press “OK”. The new
 action will now appear as actionTest in the list of actions. You can 
drag it and drop it on the File menu you created to make this action an 
entry in that menu.</p>

<div class="img-center"><img alt="see caption. screenshot of action editor highlighting the next button and showing a new action: actiontest" src="2.6.2%20Creating%20GUIs%20with%20QT%20Designer%20%7C%20GEOG%20489:%20Advanced%20Python%20Programming%20for%20GIS_arquivos/actionexit.jpg"><div class="img-caption">Figure 2.24&nbsp;A new action created in the Action Editor window</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, the “Signal/Slot Editor” tab allows for connecting signals 
of the widgets and actions created to slots of other widgets. We will 
mainly connect signals with event handler functions in our own Python 
code rather than in QT Designer, but if some widgets’ signals should be 
directly connected to slots of other widgets this can already be done 
here.</p>

<p>You now know the main components of QT Designer and a bit about how 
to place and arrange widgets in a form. We cannot teach QT Designer in 
detail here but we will show you an example of creating a larger GUI in 
QT Designer as part of the following first walkthrough of this lesson. 
If you want to learn more, there exist quite a few videos explaining 
different aspects of how to use QT Designer on the web. For now, here is
 a short video (12:21min) that we recommend checking out to see a few 
more basic examples of the interactions we briefly described above 
before moving on to the walkthrough.</p>

	<p>What is going on everybody?</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>Welcome to tutorial covering the Qtdesigner --so up until this point
 we haven't really covered much in the way of layouts because we've been
 manually coding everything via pyqt and idol so we haven't really 
covered layouts because probably the best way to do layouts is going to 
be via Qtdesigner. So it's not so much programming here as far as the 
layout is concerned but this is going to save you tons of time so it's 
pretty stupid not to use it if you ask me.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>So if you have pyqt installed and you did the full installation like
 I was showing you guys you should have the Qtdesigner. Now when you 
first open up the Qtdesigner you'll have this choice here, generally, 
you're going to choose main window or widget.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>The main window is like a main window it comes with the main menu 
and stuff so that's kind of what we want most likely but yeah so we'll 
just choose that one and then what you're given once it pops up is just a
 simple window to work with here. And just to talk real briefly about 
how the Qtdesigner is actually laid out itself, on the left hand side 
here you've got all the widgets right so you've got some layout widgets 
which we haven't talked about yet but then a bunch of other stuff like 
spacers and push buttons and checkboxes and calendar stuff and labels 
here just basically everything right that that is a part of Qt so these 
are all of our options and it's really as simple as click and drag—bam! 
You've got a button—bam! You've got a checkbox. Want a horizontal 
spacer? You got it!</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>So it’s a nice al-la-cart menu here and I don't know… let's add a label too while we're at it.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>Okay so you've got all this kind of stuff and so what it's allowing 
us to do is really just do the layout aspect. The functionality and the 
code of, you know, what happens when I push a button we still have to 
handle that but the layout we do with Qtdesigner and this is really 
really great because especially when we talk about layouts here in a 
moment you'll see that if you want to deal with those it's going take so
 much longer to do it manually especially if you change your mind.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>So once you have like a window kind of set up what you can do is 
obviously you can kind of --I mean this is basically the window—but if 
you really want to see the window—right like your horizontal spacer 
isn't going to look like that—so what you can do is you can come to form
 and then preview either preview which is control r or you can preview 
it and you can preview like the basic styles that you have access to so 
you can preview like these specific things like this or you can just 
control r and preview it you know like this so we have this window and 
if we resize this window though we'll see kind of the same problem that 
we had had initially is that the window, the stuff within the window, 
doesn't resize as it ought to so that's what we use layouts for so you 
can apply a layout to the entire window itself by just right-clicking 
somewhere in open space and then coming down to layout and just choose a
 layout.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>So you got let's do let's do a horizontal layout so then it’ll just 
give us like columns so this would be column 1 column 2 3 &amp; 4. So 
let's—this divider is basically worthless so I’m going to delete it at 
least I thought I was going to delete it get over here I can't I can't 
seem that there oh my goodness there we go okay deleted it.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>Okay so we've got those and then another example here is actually 
let's go to layout let's break that initial layout and let's give this a
 grid layout actually there we go layout and grid okay so then we can 
like move things all around and it kind of shows us the valid places 
that we could stuff stuff.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>Now the other nice thing is you can have the entire window as a grid
 layout but then you can throw in another layout like…okay we want one 
of the grid spots to be a vertical layout right and then we can kind of 
well this one isn't going to let us change the size but then we can okay
 throw in. Let's throw in a push button in there then let's try to stuff
 something else in there see if we get away with it yeah so as you can 
see this is part of that grid layout that we just built but then within 
that grid lair layout we have a vertical layout as well.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>So now though let's do control r and we can see here now we can 
resize this and everything resizes with it right and so that's pretty 
nice so some of the other things that we might have a problem with is 
like for example this says text label and this is push button and 
checkbox and all this stuff. Well, to change that it's pretty simple you
 just double-click on it and you can put whatever you want so we'll put 
hello there and then ‘push me’ and then ‘or me’ and then but ‘not me’ 
okay and something like that and check here that's good enough so then 
on this that's kind of like this the stuff that we have on the left-hand
 side here.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>But looking on the right-hand side we have object inspector we've 
got a property editor which I didn't mean to move and then we have 
resource browser now I don't really use resource browser not really sure
 what its purpose is but object inspector and property editor are pretty
 useful so the object inspector this is like for your entire window you 
know what's going on here you've got the main window then you've got the
 central widget which is this grid layout you've got the stuff that is 
within the grid layout and they've got this new vertical layout and the 
stuff that's contained within it so it's kind of the structure of the 
application then down here you've got the property editor depending on 
what you select will show up in this property editor so we could click 
on this button and we get oh it's this push button and mainly these are 
just kind of the settings you probably won't change these very very 
often but one thing you should definitely always change is the object 
name. So the object name here's push-button this is the object name like
 in your code so this button is defined by push button this one push 
button three this one push button two- that's not very useful so before 
we push this to python code we definitely want to rename these. So maybe
 this one would be you know but ‘not me’ right to be kind of going along
 with the name of the button itself and then we could name this one you 
know ‘push me’ and then this one could be ‘or me’…whoops highlight it a 
little too much there ‘or me’ okay so you can do stuff like that also if
 you ever wanted to change like the window's title you can't like you 
can't really click on the window and it pop-up but you can come over to 
the object inspector click on main window and then you come down here to
 window title and you can change the window title. So, I don't know Qt 
type that's what I’ll call it so there's that also if you want to add 
like a menu you can totally do that just double click there start typing
 stuff right file open save let's add a separator bam and then ‘exit’ 
okay instantly done all right that would have taken it's like you know I
 don't know three or four minutes to do we just did it like instantly.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>And then here luckily for us, we've got action open this one says 
action save this one's action at the exit so this one actually makes a 
little more sense automatically you don't have to change the name but 
you can if you want so there's that.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>And then obviously if you wanted to add more items as you kind of do
 stuff here right if I added edit here it gives us a new option later 
you know so as you add more to this menu bar it just automatically adds 
stuff you know so if you wanted to you could now how do we actually get 
this to python code so if you're on windows and you go say form view 
code you might get this error this is like unknown error it makes no 
sense to me why this error still is in existence but it is so what we 
want to do if that didn't work for you is you can go file save as and we
 can save this. I'm going to save it in this really deep directory in 
testing and we're going to call this a pyqtdesigner and it'll be a .ui 
file that's just what it's being saved as. We'll go ahead and save that 
no problem so I have that file now it's just right in here and what we 
want to do now is open up a console in there so open command window into
 there so make sure you're in the actual directory of that file right so
 that's where the file is that's the path to this file so if you don't 
know how to do that you can always hold shift and right click the 
directory and you can open a command window there.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>So once you've done that now we have to enter in some code to get 
this to convert so if you if you can you could sometimes get away with 
just doing py uic - x for executable and then we can change we can say 
pyqtdesigner.ui that's what I said it is-- yeah and then - oh for the 
output file and we're just we'll say pyqtdesigner.py but I don't think 
this will end up working for me but it might work for you we'll try it 
right so it's probably gonna come up and say it's not recognized as a 
command. So now we need to reference that py.uic file it's like a batch 
file so now let's reference that so it would be c colon slash python 34 
or whatever version you're using and then lib/ sit -packages / pyqt4 or 5
 or 6 or whatever is at the time that you're watching this /piyuic4.bat 
and then same thing as before –x for executable if you don't use the x 
it won't like actually create a window it'll just be a bunch of 
definitions you can run it but it's not going to do anything and then we
 want to do this pyqtdesigner.ui and then we want to do the -o and then 
we'll do the output to pyqtdesigner.py.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>Okay so we'll do that, hit enter and you should now have a new file 
there right it should be pyqtdesigner we can open it and edit with idol 
here's all that code again there's no real functionality - it's just the
 layout and just the ui only but let's go ahead and run that and sure 
enough. Here's our window and that's that so you've got all the python 
code there you did it in the designer obviously this isn't really any 
advanced code but hey we built that in like 10 minutes so that would 
have taken us a lot longer than ten minutes to build all of that 
including—especially thinking about like the layouts that are involved 
here and then like what happens when you're like hmm I want to change 
layouts well that's a really kind of a challenge especially if you have 
like a lot of stuff inside your layouts to kind of mentally go through 
what objects need to be moved to what place in your code that's pretty 
hard and so having the Qtdesigner there just it makes it so much simpler
 so anyways that's just a really quick introduction to Qtdesigner 
obviously there's a whole lot more to it this was kind of a silly 
application but from here all we really need to do is you know use 
connect to connect functions to these buttons but we've already covered 
how to do that so I’m not going to waste any time and do these simple 
connections to the buttons but hopefully you can see now how powerful 
just Qtdesigner is because really, as far as I know, there's no tk 
designer but maybe I’m wrong. If I’m wrong let me know but Qtdesigner 
just makes things so much easier so anyways that's it for this tutorial 
if you have any questions or comments go ahead and leave them below 
otherwise as always thanks for watching, thanks for all the support and 
subscriptions. Until next time.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have created the form(s) for the GUI of your program and 
saved them as .ui file(s), you can translate them into Python code with 
the help of the pyuic5 tool, e.g. by running a command like the 
following from the command line using the tool directly with Python :</p>

<pre>"C:\Users<username>\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\ESRI\conda\envs\arcgispro-py3-clone\python.exe" –m PyQt5.uic.pyuic mainwindow.ui –o mainwindow.py
</username></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>"C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe" –m PyQt5.uic.pyuic mainwindow.ui –o mainwindow.py
</pre>

<p>depending on where your default Python environment is located (don't 
forget to replace &lt;username&gt; with your actual user name in the 
first version and if you get an error with this command try typing it 
in, not copying/pasting). mainwindow.ui here is the name of the file 
produced with QT Designer and what follows the -o is the name of the 
output file that should be produced with the Python version of the GUI. 
If you want, you can do this for your own .ui file now and have a quick 
look at the produced .py file and see whether you understand some of the

 file to create the GUI from your Python code as part of the walkthrough
 in the next section.</p>
