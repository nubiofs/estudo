  <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>While
 in lessons 1 and 2 we mainly focused on advanced Python programming 
approaches within the ESRI ArcGIS world, lesson 3 involved a step away 
from proprietary GIS software towards open source Python libraries and 
software tools, even though one of the main points we wanted to make in 
this lesson was that both worlds are not as separated as one might 
think. In this final lesson of the course, we will be leaving ArcGIS 
behind completely and take a closer look at the open source alternative 
QGIS, a free desktop GIS that most likely you have already heard of.</p>

<p>While the history of open source GIS software goes back more than 30 
years, open source desktop GIS software has only very recently reached a
 level of maturity and intuitive usability that can be considered 
comparable to proprietary desktop GIS software. With desktop GIS 
software we mean standalone software that can be installed and run 
locally on a computer and that makes the most common GIS data 
manipulation and analysis functionalities (for at least both raster and 
vector data) accessible via an easy-to-use GUI, similar to the ArcGIS 
Desktop products. However, these days there do exist multiple such open 
source alternatives, including the ones we briefly list below:</p>

<h3>Grass GIS</h3>

<p><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/">Grass (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System)</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>
 is the ancestor of open source GIS but is still under active 
development, with a history of more than 30 years. Its development was 
started by the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories 
in 1982 but it is now maintained by the <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">Open Source Geospatial Foundation</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span>
 (OSGeo) under GNU GPL license. Grass is largely written in C/C++ and 
provides a large collection of GIS tools grouped into modules. Other 
open source GIS systems, such as QGIS for example, integrate these GRASS
 modules to extend their functionality.</p>

<h3>gvSIG Desktop</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.gvsig.com/products/gvsig-desktop">gvSIG Desktop</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span>
 is a much younger open source software by gvSIG Association written in 
Java. Its initial release was in 2004. Similar to Grass, it is published
 under the GNU GPL license. The most recent version (at the time of this
 writing) is 2.4 released in February 2018.</p>

<h3>MapWindow GIS</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.mapwindow.org/#about">MapWindow</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span>
 is an open source project that in contrast to most of the others listed
 here is only available on Windows. It is written in C# for the .NET 
platform, available under the Mozilla Public License, and maintained and
 updated by a team of volunteers. MapWindow is available in version 4. 
In 2015, a complete rewrite of the software was started that is 
currently available as MapWindow5 version 5.2.0.</p>

<h3>OpenJump</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.openjump.org/">OpenJump</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span>,
 originally called Jump GIS and designed by Vivid Solutions, is another 
Java based open source GIS software developed by a team of volunteers. 
Like most other GIS systems, it provides an interface for creating 
plugins to extend its functionality. The latest release is from April 
2017, so development of the core seems to have slowed down a bit. 
OpenJump is published under GNU GPL license.</p>

<h3>SPRING</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.spring-gis.org/languages/english/index.html">SPRING</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span>
 is a freeware GIS and one of the older GIS systems available. It is 
developed by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) 
since 1992. In particular, it provides advanced remote sensing data and 
image processing capabilities. SPRING requires you to register before 
being able to acquire the software and has a special license specifying 
how it can be used.</p>

<h3>uDig</h3>

<p><a href="http://udig.refractions.net/">uDig</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>
 is a Java-based GIS system that is embedded into the Eclipse platform. 
It is developed by Refractions Research and published under Eclipse 
Public License EPL. Currently, the newest available version is the 
release candidate for version 2.0.</p>

<h3>QGIS&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Lastly, we come to <a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span>,
 the open source software that this lesson will mainly be about. 
Development of QGIS was started in 2002 by Gary Sherman under the name 
Quantum GIS. QGIS publishes updates in short intervals and a new 
milestone has been reached with the release of version 3.0 in February 
2018. QGIS is by many considered to be the leading open-source desktop 
GIS software due to the broad range of functionality it provides, its 
easy-to-use and flexible interface, and the very active community. QGIS 
has been written in C++ and Python. It provides an interface for 
extending its capabilities via plugins written in Python that we will 
work with later on in this lesson. QGIS is developed by a team of 
volunteers and organizations, and supported by the <a href="https://www.osgeo.org/">Open Source Geospatial Foundation</a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span> umbrella organization for open source GIS software. It is published under GNU GPL license.</p>
From a programming perspective, the focus of this lesson will be on <em>object-oriented programming</em>
 in Python with the goal of gaining a better understanding of some 
concepts like objects and classes that we have already been using quite a
 lot in Geog485 and in the first lessons of this course. But now we will
 study this topic in more depth and you will learn how to write your own
 classes and use them effectively in your own programming projects to 
produce better-structured code that is also more readable and easier to 
maintain. You will apply what you learned theoretically in this lesson 
to write plugins for QGIS to extend its capabilities. Implementing these
 plugins will also include further GUI designing work with QT as a 
continuation of what you learned in lesson 2. However, before we further
 talk about object-oriented programming, we provide a brief overview on 
QGIS in the next section.
