David Chataur@http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03009v2@Intersection Homology. General perversities and topological invariance@"Topological invariance of the intersection homology of a pseudomanifold
without codimension one strata, proven by Goresky and MacPherson, is one of the
main features of this homology. This property is true for strata codimension
depending perversities with some growth conditions, verifying $\overline
p(1)=\overline p(2)=0$. King reproves this invariance by associating an
intrinsic pseudomanifold $X^*$ to any pseudomanifold $X$. His proof consists of
an isomorphism between the associated intersection homologies
$H^{\overline{p}}_{*}(X) \cong H^{\overline{p}}_{*}(X^*)$ for any perversity
$\overline{p}$ with the same growth conditions verifying $\overline p(1)\geq
0$.
  In this work, we prove a certain topological invariance within the framework
of strata depending perversities, $\overline{p}$, which corresponds to the
classical topological invariance if $\overline{p}$ is a GM-perversity. We also
extend it to the tame intersection homology, a variation of the intersection
homology, particularly suited for ""large"" perversities, if there is no singular
strata on $X$ becoming regular in $X^*$. In particular, under the above
conditions, the intersection homology and the tame intersection homology are

homotopical analog of the Sylow theorems for finite $\infty$-groups. We derive

Luis A. Pereira@http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06618v1@"Operad bimodules, and composition products on Andre-Quillen filtrations
  of algebras"@"If O is a reduced operad in symmetric spectra, an O-algebra I can be viewed
as analogous to the augmentation ideal of an augmented algebra. Implicit in the
literature on Topological Andre-Quillen homology is that such an I admits a
canonical (and homotopically meaningful) decreasing O-algebra filtration I >
I^2 > I^3 > ... satisfying various nice properties analogous to powers of an
ideal in a ring.
  In this paper, we are explicit about these constructions. With R a
commutative S-algebra, we study derived versions of the circle product M o_O I,
where M is an O-bimodule, and I is an O-algebra in R-modules. Letting M run
through a decreasing O-bimodule filtration of O itself then yields the
augmentation ideal filtration as above. The composition structure of the operad
induces algebra maps from (I^i)^j to I^{ij}, fitting nicely with previously
studied structure.
  As a formal consequence, an O-algebra map from I to J^d induces compatible
maps from I^n to J^{dn}, for all n. This is an essential tool in the first
author's study of Hurewicz maps for infinite loop spaces, and its utility is
illustrated here with a lifting theorem."@2016

Ralph M. Kaufmann@http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08247v1@Permutahedral Structures of $E_2$ Operads@"There are basically two interesting breeds of $E_2$ operads, those that
detect loop spaces and those that solve Deligne's conjecture. The former
deformation retract to Milgram's space obtained by gluing together permutahedra
at their faces. We show how the second breed can be covered by permutahedra as
well. Even more is true, the quotient is actually already an operad up to
homotopy, which induces the operad structure on cellular chains adapted to
prove Deligne's conjecture, while no such structure is known on Milgram's
space. We show, explicitely, that these two quotients are homotopy equivalent.
This gives a new topological proof that operads of this type are indeed of the
right homotopy type. It also furnishes a very nice clean description in terms
of polyhedra, and with it PL topology, for the whole story. The permutahedra
and partial orders play a central role. This, in turn, provides direct links to
other fields of mathematics. We for instance find a new cellular decomposition
of permutahedra using partial orders and that the permutahedra give the cells
for the Dyer--Lashof operations."@2016

Morten Brun@http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05939v1@Equivariant Structure on Smash Powers@"We provide foundations for dealing with the equivariant structure of ""smash

orthogonal ring spectra $A$ is tensored over spaces $X$, so that $A \otimes X$
is a commutative orthogonal ring spectrum. If $X$ is a discrete space, this is
literally the smash power of $A$ with itself indexed over $X$, and we keep this
language also in the nondiscrete case. In particular $A \otimes S^1$ is a model
for topological Hochschild homology. We provide a framework where a
generalization of the cyclotomic structure of topological Hochschild homology
is visible in a categorical framework, also for more general $G$ and $X$.
  Similar situations have been studied by others, e.g., in Hill, Hopkins and
Ravenel's treatment of the norm construction and Brun, Carlsson, Dundas'
covering homology. In the case of non-commutative $A$ and $X=S^1$, the
situation is somewhat easier and has already been covered by Kro. We are
motivated by applications to $G$ being a torus in order to study the iterated
algebraic $K$-theory, and have to develop a categorical theory that in some
ways goes beyond what has been done before.

topological analysis revealed that directed graphs representing connectivity
among neurons in the microcircuit deviated significantly from different

the order of $10^7$ simplices {\DH} groups of neurons with all-to-all directed
connectivity. Some of these simplices contained up to 8 neurons, making them
the most extreme neuronal clustering motif ever reported. Functional

the usefulness of this approach, by introducing the concept of decorated

functor $\mathcal O$ to a monoidal category to produce a new Feynman category
${\mathfrak F}_{dec {\mathcal O}}$. This in one swat explains the existence of
non--sigma operads, non--sigma cyclic operads, and the non--sigma--modular
operads of Markl as well as all the usual candidates simply from the category
$\mathfrak G$, which is a full subcategory of the category of graphs of [BM08].
Moreover, we explain the appearance of terminal objects noted in [Mar15]. We
can then easily extend this for instance to the dihedral case. Furthermore, we
obtain graph complexes and all other known operadic type notions from
decorating and restricting the basic Feynman category $\mathfrak G$ of
aggregates of corollas. We additionally show that the construction is
functorial. There are further geometric and number theoretic applications,

admitting $\Gamma$-structures are free over odd degree generators. We prove
that this condition is also sufficient for the existence of $\Gamma$-structures

homogeneous spaces with connected isotropy groups.
  Passing to a more geometric perspective we show that on compact oriented
Riemannian symmetric spaces with connected isotropy groups and free rational

$\Gamma$-structures. This extends work of Albers, Frauenfelder and Solomon on

on the multidimensional matching distance. While this metric is rather simple
to define and compute by considering a suitable family of filtering functions
associated with lines having a positive slope, it has two main drawbacks.
First, it forgets the natural link between the homological properties of
filtrations associated with lines that are close to each other. As a
consequence, part of the interesting homological information is lost. Second,
its intrinsically discontinuous definition makes it difficult to study its
properties. In this paper we introduce a new matching distance for 2D
persistent Betti numbers, called coherent matching distance and based on
matchings that change coherently with the filtrations we take into account. Its
definition is not trivial, as it must face the presence of monodromy in
multidimensional persistence, i.e. the fact that different paths in the space
parameterizing the above filtrations can induce different matchings between the
associated persistent diagrams. In our paper we prove that the coherent 2D

can be performed in the Morse-Smale case without altering the underlying smooth
manifold. We posit that if two framed flow categories represent the same stable
homotopy type then a finite sequence of these moves is sufficient to connect
the two categories. This is directed towards the goal of reducing the study of
framed flow categories to a combinatorial calculus.
  We provide examples of calculations performed with these moves (related to
the Khovanov framed flow category), and prove some general results about the
simplification of framed flow categories via these moves."@2016

  Type Theory"@"This paper continues investigations in ""synthetic homotopy theory"": the use
of homotopy type theory to give machine-checked proofs of constructions from
homotopy theory
  We present a mechanized proof of the Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem, a
result relating the higher-dimensional homotopy groups of a pushout type
(roughly, a space constructed by gluing two spaces along a shared subspace) to
those of the components of the pushout. This theorem gives important
information about the pushout type, and has a number of useful corollaries,
including the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which has been studied in
previous formalizations.
  The new proof is more elementary than existing ones in abstract
homotopy-theoretic settings, and the mechanization is concise and high-level,
thanks to novel combinations of ideas from homotopy theory and type theory."@2016

block}---i.e. a horizontal band, a vertical band, an upper-right quadrant, or a
lower-left quadrant. Assuming the modules are pointwise finite dimensional
(pfd), we show that they are decomposable into block summands if and only if
they satisfy a certain local property called {\em exactness}. Our proof follows
the same scheme as the proof of decomposition for pfd persistence modules
indexed over $\mathbb{R}$, yet it departs from it at key stages due to the
product order on $\mathbb{R}^2$ not being a total order, which leaves some
important gaps open. These gaps are filled in using more direct arguments. Our
work is motivated primarily by the stability theory for zigzags and
interlevel-sets persistence modules, in which block-decomposable bimodules play
a key part. Our results allow us to drop some of the conditions under which
that theory holds, in particular the Morse-type conditions."@2016

Namely, we consider the property of being left proper and the structures of a

that is compatible with the weak cofibration structure). For the purpose of

Lori Ziegelmeier@http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02196v2@"Persistent Homology on Grassmann Manifolds for Analysis of Hyperspectral
  Movies"@"The existence of characteristic structure, or shape, in complex data sets has
been recognized as increasingly important for mathematical data analysis. This
realization has motivated the development of new tools such as persistent
homology for exploring topological invariants, or features, in large data sets.
In this paper we apply persistent homology to the characterization of gas
plumes in time dependent sequences of hyperspectral cubes, i.e. the analysis of
4-way arrays. We investigate hyperspectral movies of Long-Wavelength Infrared
data monitoring an experimental release of chemical simulant into the air. Our
approach models regions of interest within the hyperspectral data cubes as
points on the real Grassmann manifold $G(k, n)$ (whose points parameterize the
$k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$), contrasting our approach with the
more standard framework in Euclidean space. An advantage of this approach is
that it allows a sequence of time slices in a hyperspectral movie to be
collapsed to a sequence of points in such a way that some of the key structure
within and between the slices is encoded by the points on the Grassmann
manifold. This motivates the search for topological features, associated with
the evolution of the frames of a hyperspectral movie, within the corresponding
points on the Grassmann manifold. The proposed mathematical model affords the
processing of large data sets while retaining valuable discriminatory
information. In this paper, we discuss how embedding our data in the Grassmann
manifold, together with topological data analysis, captures dynamical events
that occur as the chemical plume is released and evolves."@2016

Farb. We show that the rational homology of configuration spaces of ordered
particles in noncompact manifolds satisfies secondary representation stability.
While representation stability for the homology of configuration spaces
involves stabilizing by introducing particles near the boundary, secondary
representation stability involves stabilizing by introducing pairs of orbiting
particles. This result can be thought of as a representation-theoretic analogue
of secondary homological stability in the sense of Galatius, Kupers, and
Randal-Williams. In the course of the proof we establish some additional
results: we give a new characterization of the integral homology of the complex
of injective words, and we give a new proof of integral representation
stability for configuration spaces of noncompact manifolds, extending previous
results to nonorientable manifolds. In an appendix, we use results on
FI-homology to give explicit stable ranges for the integral cohomology of
configuration spaces of closed manifolds."@2016

compute the additive invariants of orbifolds (equipped with a sheaf of Azumaya
algebras) using solely ""fixed-point data"". As a consequence, we recover, in a
unified and conceptual way, the original results of Vistoli concerning
algebraic K-theory, of Baranovsky concerning cyclic homology, of the second
author with Polishchuk concerning Hochschild homology, and of Baranovsky-Petrov
and Caldararu-Arinkin (unpublished) concerning twisted Hochschild homology; in
the case of topological Hochschild homology and periodic topological cyclic
homology, the aforementioned computation is new in the literature. As an
application, we verify Grothendieck's standard conjectures of type C and D, as
well as Voevodsky's smash-nilpotence conjecture, in the case of
""low-dimensional"" orbifolds. Finally, we establish a result of independent
interest concerning nilpotency in the Grothendieck ring of an orbifold."@2016

Manuel Rivera@http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04801v5@Cubical rigidification, the cobar construction, and the based loop space@"We prove the following generalization of a classical result of Adams: for any
pointed and connected topological space $(X,b)$, that is not necessarily simply
connected, the cobar construction of the differential graded (dg) coalgebra of
normalized singular chains in $X$ with vertices at $b$ is weakly equivalent as
a differential graded associative algebra (dga) to the singular chains on the
Moore based loop space of $X$ at $b$. We deduce this statement from several
more general categorical results of independent interest. We construct a
functor $\mathfrak{C}_{\square_c}$ from simplicial sets to categories enriched
over cubical sets with connections which, after triangulation of their mapping
spaces, coincides with Lurie's rigidification functor $\mathfrak{C}$ from
simplicial sets to simplicial categories. Taking normalized chains of the
mapping spaces of $\mathfrak{C}_{\square_c}$ yields a functor $\Lambda$ from
simplicial sets to dg categories which is the left adjoint to the dg nerve
functor. For any simplicial set $S$ with $S_0=\{x\}$, $\Lambda(S)(x,x)$ is a
dga isomorphic to $\Omega Q_{\Delta}(S)$, the cobar construction on the dg
coalgebra $Q_{\Delta}(S)$ of normalized chains on $S$. We use these facts to
show that $Q_{\Delta}$ sends categorical equivalences between simplicial sets
to maps of connected dg coalgebras which induce quasi-isomorphisms of dga's

Andrew Tonks@http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00196v2@"Three Hopf algebras and their common simplicial and categorical
  background"@"We consider three a priori totally different setups for Hopf algebras from
number theory, mathematical physics and algebraic topology. These are the Hopf
algebras of Goncharov for multiple zeta values, that of Connes--Kreimer for
renormalization, and a Hopf algebra constructed by Baues to study double loop
spaces. We show that these examples can be successively unified by considering
simplicial objects, cooperads with multiplication and Feynman categories at the
ultimate level. These considerations open the door to new constructions and
reinterpretation of known constructions in a large common framework."@2016
