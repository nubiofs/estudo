information from metric datasets, its applicability to more general data, e.g.
directed networks, is hindered by its natural insensitivity to asymmetry. We
study a construction of homology of digraphs due to Grigor'yan, Lin, Muranov
and Yau, and extend this construction to the persistent framework. The result,
which we call persistent path homology, can provide information about the
digraph structure of a directed network at varying resolutions. Moreover, this
method encodes a rich level of detail about the asymmetric structure of the
input directed network. We test our method on both simulated and real-world
directed networks and conjecture some of its characteristics."@2017

  In this paper, we establish the main properties of this cohomology. One of
its major feature is the existence of cap and cup products for any filtered
space and any commutative ring of coefficients, at the cochain level. Moreover,
we show that each stratified map induces an homomorphism between the blown-up
intersection cohomologies, compatible with the cup and cap products. We prove
also its topological invariance in the case of a pseudomanifold with no
codimension one strata. Finally, we compare it with the intersection cohomology

the study of the topology of various spaces of embeddings of one manifold in
another. Given a space of embeddings, the theory produces a Taylor tower whose
purpose is to approximate this space in a suitable sense. Central to the story
are deep theorems about the convergence of this tower. We provide an exposition
of the convergence results in the special case of embeddings into $\mathbb
R^n$, which has been the case of primary interest in applications. We try to
use as little machinery as possible and give several improvements and

$K$, and $\cA$ a transitive Lie algebroid on $M$. The Lie algebroid restriction
of $\cA$ to a simplex $\Delta$ of $K$ is denoted by $\cA^{!!}_{\Delta}$. A
piecewise smooth form of degree $p$ on $\cA$ is a family
$\omega=(\omega_{\Delta})_{\Delta\in K}$ such that $\omega_{\Delta}\in
\Omega^{p}(\cA^{!!}_{\Delta};\Delta)$ for each $\Delta\in K$, satisfying the
compatibility condition concerning the restrictions of $\omega_{\Delta}$ to the
faces of $\Delta$, that is, if $\Delta'$ is a face of $\Delta$, the restriction
of the form $\omega_{\Delta}$ to the simplex $\Delta'$ coincides with the form
$\omega_{\Delta'}$. The set $\Omega^{\ast}(\cA;K)$ of all piecewise smooth
forms on $\cA$ is a cochain algebra. One has a natural morphism
$$\Omega^{\ast}(\cA;M)\rightarrow \Omega^{\ast}(\cA;K)$$ of cochain algebras
given by restriction of a smooth form defined on $\cA$ to a smooth form defined
on $\cA^{!!}_{\Delta}$, for all simplices $\Delta$ of $K$. In this paper, we
prove that, for triangulated compact manifolds, the cohomology of this
construction is isomorphic to the Lie algebroid cohomology of $\cA$, in which
the isomorphism is induced by the restriction map."@2017
