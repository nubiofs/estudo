information from metric datasets, its applicability to more general data, e.g.
directed networks, is hindered by its natural insensitivity to asymmetry. We
study a construction of homology of digraphs due to Grigor'yan, Lin, Muranov
and Yau, and extend this construction to the persistent framework. The result,
which we call persistent path homology, can provide information about the
digraph structure of a directed network at varying resolutions. Moreover, this
method encodes a rich level of detail about the asymmetric structure of the
input directed network. We test our method on both simulated and real-world
directed networks and conjecture some of its characteristics."@2017

  In this paper, we establish the main properties of this cohomology. One of
its major feature is the existence of cap and cup products for any filtered
space and any commutative ring of coefficients, at the cochain level. Moreover,
we show that each stratified map induces an homomorphism between the blown-up

also its topological invariance in the case of a pseudomanifold with no
codimension one strata. Finally, we compare it with the intersection cohomology

the study of the topology of various spaces of embeddings of one manifold in
another. Given a space of embeddings, the theory produces a Taylor tower whose
purpose is to approximate this space in a suitable sense. Central to the story
are deep theorems about the convergence of this tower. We provide an exposition
of the convergence results in the special case of embeddings into $\mathbb

use as little machinery as possible and give several improvements and

piecewise smooth form of degree $p$ on $\cA$ is a family
$\omega=(\omega_{\Delta})_{\Delta\in K}$ such that $\omega_{\Delta}\in
\Omega^{p}(\cA^{!!}_{\Delta};\Delta)$ for each $\Delta\in K$, satisfying the
compatibility condition concerning the restrictions of $\omega_{\Delta}$ to the
faces of $\Delta$, that is, if $\Delta'$ is a face of $\Delta$, the restriction
of the form $\omega_{\Delta}$ to the simplex $\Delta'$ coincides with the form
$\omega_{\Delta'}$. The set $\Omega^{\ast}(\cA;K)$ of all piecewise smooth
forms on $\cA$ is a cochain algebra. One has a natural morphism
$$\Omega^{\ast}(\cA;M)\rightarrow \Omega^{\ast}(\cA;K)$$ of cochain algebras
given by restriction of a smooth form defined on $\cA$ to a smooth form defined
on $\cA^{!!}_{\Delta}$, for all simplices $\Delta$ of $K$. In this paper, we
prove that, for triangulated compact manifolds, the cohomology of this
construction is isomorphic to the Lie algebroid cohomology of $\cA$, in which
the isomorphism is induced by the restriction map."@2017

all possible) to evaluate. Here we take the opposite view on the problem and
show that the bottleneck distance is in fact good enough {\em locally}, in the
sense that it is able to discriminate a Reeb graph from any other Reeb graph in
a small enough neighborhood, as efficiently as the other metrics do. This
suggests considering the {\em intrinsic metrics} induced by these distances,
which turn out to be all {\em globally} equivalent. This novel viewpoint on the
study of Reeb graphs has a potential impact on applications, where one may not
only be interested in discriminating between data but also in interpolating
between them."@2017

neural recordings of mice moving freely in a box, where we find a circular
feature. We then observe that the decoded value corresponds well to the head
direction of the mouse. Thus we capture head direction cells and decode the
head direction from the neural population activity without having to process
the behaviour of the mouse. Interestingly, the decoded values convey more
information about the neural activity than the tracked head direction does,
with differences that have some spatial organization. Finally, we note that the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04064v4@Woojin Kim@"Stable Signatures for Dynamic Graphs and Dynamic Metric Spaces via
  Zigzag Persistence"@"When studying flocking/swarming behaviors in animals one is interested in
quantifying and comparing the dynamics of the clustering induced by the
coalescence and disbanding of animals in different groups. In a similar vein,
studying the dynamics of social networks leads to the problem of characterizing
groups/communities as they form and disperse throughout time.
  Motivated by this, we study the problem of obtaining persistent homology
based summaries of time-dependent data. Given a finite dynamic graph (DG), we
first construct a zigzag persistence module arising from linearizing the
dynamic transitive graph naturally induced from the input DG. Based on standard
results, we then obtain a persistence diagram or barcode from this zigzag
persistence module. We prove that these barcodes are stable under perturbations
in the input DG under a suitable distance between DGs that we identify.
  More precisely, our stability theorem can be interpreted as providing a lower
bound for the distance between DGs. Since it relies on barcodes, and their
bottleneck distance, this lower bound can be computed in polynomial time from
the DG inputs.
  Since DGs can be given rise by applying the Rips functor (with a fixed
threshold) to dynamic metric spaces, we are also able to derive related stable
invariants for these richer class of dynamic objects.
  Along the way, we propose a summarization of dynamic graphs that captures
their time-dependent clustering features which we call formigrams. These
set-valued functions generalize the notion of dendrogram, a prevalent tool for
hierarchical clustering. In order to elucidate the relationship between our
distance between two DGs and the bottleneck distance between their associated
barcodes, we exploit recent advances in the stability of zigzag persistence due
to Botnan and Lesnick, and to Bjerkevik."@2017

http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00922v4@Benoît Guerville-Ballé@Configurations of points and topology of real line arrangements@"A central question in the study of line arrangements in the complex
projective plane $\mathbb{CP}^2$ is: when does the combinatorial data of the
arrangement determine its topological properties? In the present work, we
introduce a topological invariant of complexified real line arrangements, the
chamber weight. This invariant is based on the weight counting over the points
of the arrangement dual configuration, located in particular chambers of the
real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, dealing only with geometrical
properties.
  Using this dual point of view, we construct several examples of complexified
real line arrangements with the same combinatorial data and different
embeddings in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (i.e. Zariski pairs), which are distinguished by
this invariant. In particular, we obtain new Zariski pairs of 13, 15 and 17
lines defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and containing only double and triple points.
For each one of them, we can derive degenerations, containing points of
multiplicity 2, 3 and 5, which are also Zariski pairs.
  We explicitly compute the moduli space of the combinatorics of one of these
examples, and prove that it has exactly two connected components. We also
obtain three geometric characterizations of these components: the existence of
two smooth conics, one tangent to six lines and the other containing six triple
points, as well as the collinearity of three specific triple points."@2017

is a natural homological extension of representation varieties of fundamental
groups. We give an elementary construction of representation homology in terms
of classical (abelian) homological algebra. Our construction is parallel to the
Loday-Pirashvili construction of higher Hochschild homology; in fact, we
establish a direct geometric relation between the two theories by showing that
the representation homology of the (reduced) suspension of a (pointed
connected) space is isomorphic to its higher Hochschild homology. We also
construct some natural maps and spectral sequences relating representation
homology to other standard homology theories associated with spaces (such as
Pontryagin algebras, S^1-equivariant homology of the free loop space and stable
homology of automorphism groups of f.g. free groups). We compute representation
homology explicitly (in terms of known invariants) in a number of interesting
cases, including spheres, suspensions, complex projective spaces, Riemann
surfaces and some 3-dimensional manifolds (such as link complements in R^3 and

${\mathbb A}^1$-homotopy theory. By combining affine representability results
with techniques of obstruction theory, we establish classification results over
smooth affine schemes of small dimension. In particular, for smooth affine
schemes over algebraically closed fields, we show that generically split
octonion algebras may be classified by characteristic classes including the
second Chern class and another ""mod $3$"" invariant. We review Zorn's ""vector
matrix"" construction of octonion algebras, generalized to rings by various
authors, and show that generically split octonion algebras are always obtained
from this construction over smooth affine schemes of low dimension. Finally,
generalizing P. Gille's analysis of octonion algebras with trivial norm form,
we observe that generically split octonion algebras with trivial associated
spinor bundle are automatically split in low dimensions."@2017

extract meaningful patterns. This is especially the case when dealing with
textual data. Recent studies in machine learning, information theory and
network science have developed several novel instruments to extract the
semantics of unstructured data, and harness it to build a network of relations.
Such approaches serve as an efficient tool for dimensionality reduction and
pattern detection. This paper applies semantic network science to extract
ideological proximity in the international arena, by focusing on the data from
General Debates in the UN General Assembly on the topics of high salience to
international community. UN General Debate corpus (UNGDC) covers all high-level
debates in the UN General Assembly from 1970 to 2014, covering all UN member
states. The research proceeds in three main steps. First, Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) is used to extract the topics of the UN speeches, and
therefore semantic information. Each country is then assigned a vector
specifying the exposure to each of the topics identified. This intermediate
output is then used in to construct a network of countries based on information

http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09491v1@Slava Mikhaylov@"Topology Analysis of International Networks Based on Debates in the
  United Nations"@"In complex, high dimensional and unstructured data it is often difficult to
extract meaningful patterns. This is especially the case when dealing with
textual data. Recent studies in machine learning, information theory and
network science have developed several novel instruments to extract the
semantics of unstructured data, and harness it to build a network of relations.
Such approaches serve as an efficient tool for dimensionality reduction and
pattern detection. This paper applies semantic network science to extract
ideological proximity in the international arena, by focusing on the data from
General Debates in the UN General Assembly on the topics of high salience to
international community. UN General Debate corpus (UNGDC) covers all high-level
debates in the UN General Assembly from 1970 to 2014, covering all UN member
states. The research proceeds in three main steps. First, Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) is used to extract the topics of the UN speeches, and
therefore semantic information. Each country is then assigned a vector
specifying the exposure to each of the topics identified. This intermediate
output is then used in to construct a network of countries based on information
theoretical metrics where the links capture similar vectorial patterns in the
topic distributions. Topology of the networks is then analyzed through network
properties like density, path length and clustering. Finally, we identify
specific topological features of our networks using the map equation framework

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07456v2@Graham White@Families of nested graphs with compatible symmetric-group actions@"For fixed positive integers $n$ and $k$, the Kneser graph $KG_{n,k}$ has
vertices labeled by $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ and edges between
disjoint sets. Keeping $k$ fixed and allowing $n$ to grow, one obtains a family
of nested graphs, each of which is acted on by a symmetric group in a way which
is compatible with all of the other actions. In this paper, we provide a
framework for studying families of this kind using the FI-module theory of
Church, Ellenberg, and Farb, and show that this theory has a variety of

First, we create a weighted directed graph G using the 1-skeleton of the
Mapper. We use the average values at the vertices of a target function to
direct edges (from low to high). The difference between the average values at
vertices (high-low) is set as the edge's weight. Covariation of the remaining h
functions (independent variables) is captured by a h-bit binary signature

all have the same signature. We define the interestingness score of such a path
as a sum of its edge weights multiplied by a nonlinear function of their ranks
in the path.
  Second, we study three optimization problems on this graph G. In the problem
Max-IP, we seek an interesting path in G with the maximum interestingness
score. We show that Max-IP is NP-complete. For the special case when G is a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), we show that Max-IP can be solved in polynomial

set of new topological and geometric tools to infer relevant features for
possibly complex data. This paper is a brief introduction, through a few
selected topics, to basic fundamental and practical aspects of tda for non
experts. 1 Introduction and motivation Topological Data Analysis (tda) is a
recent eld that emerged from various works in applied (algebraic) topology and
computational geometry during the rst decade of the century. Although one can
trace back geometric approaches for data analysis quite far in the past, tda
really started as a eld with the pioneering works of Edelsbrunner et al. (2002)
and Zomorodian and Carlsson (2005) in persistent homology and was popularized
in a landmark paper in 2009 Carlsson (2009). tda is mainly motivated by the
idea that topology and geometry provide a powerful approach to infer robust
qualitative, and sometimes quantitative, information about the structure of
data-see, e.g. Chazal (2017). tda aims at providing well-founded mathematical,
statistical and algorithmic methods to infer, analyze and exploit the complex
topological and geometric structures underlying data that are often represented
as point clouds in Euclidean or more general metric spaces. During the last few
years, a considerable eort has been made to provide robust and ecient data
structures and algorithms for tda that are now implemented and available and
easy to use through standard libraries such as the Gudhi library (C++ and
Python) Maria et al. (2014) and its R software interface Fasy et al. (2014a).
Although it is still rapidly evolving, tda now provides a set of mature and
ecient tools that can be used in combination or complementary to other data
sciences tools. The tdapipeline. tda has recently known developments in various
directions and application elds. There now exist a large variety of methods
inspired by topological and geometric approaches. Providing a complete overview
of all these existing approaches is beyond the scope of this introductory
survey. However, most of them rely on the following basic and standard pipeline
that will serve as the backbone of this paper: 1. The input is assumed to be a
nite set of points coming with a notion of distance-or similarity between them.
This distance can be induced by the metric in the ambient space (e.g. the
Euclidean metric when the data are embedded in R d) or come as an intrinsic
metric dened by a pairwise distance matrix. The denition of the metric on the
data is usually given as an input or guided by the application. It is however

  Superconductors/Insulators and Quantum Spin Liquids in 3+1D"@"We introduce a web of strongly correlated interacting 3+1D topological
superconductors/insulators of 10 particular global symmetry groups of Cartan
classes, realizable in electronic condensed matter systems, and their new SU(N)
generalizations. The symmetries include SU(N), SU(2), U(1), fermion parity,
time reversal and relate to each other through symmetry embeddings. We overview
the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. We complete the list of field theories of
bulk symmetry-protected topological invariants (SPT invariants/partition
functions that exhibit boundary 't Hooft anomalies) via cobordism calculations,
matching their full classification. We also present explicit 4-manifolds that
detect these SPTs. On the other hand, once we dynamically gauge part of their
global symmetries, we arrive in various new phases of SU(N) Yang-Mills (YM)
gauge theories, analogous to quantum spin liquids with emergent gauge fields.
We discuss how coupling YM theories to time reversal-SPTs affects the strongly
coupled theories at low energy. For example, we point out a possibility of
having two deconfined gapless time-reversal symmetric SU(2) YM theories at
$\theta=\pi$ as two distinct conformal field theories, which although are
secretly indistinguishable by correlators of local operators on orientable
spacetimes nor by gapped SPT states, can be distinguished on non-orientable
spacetimes or potentially by correlators of extended operators."@2017
