introduce the concept of filtered covers. We show that the persistent homology
of a bounded metric space obtained from the \v{C}ech complex is the persistent
homology of the filtered nerve of the filtered \v{C}ech cover. Given a
parameter $\delta$ with $0 < \delta \le 1$ we introduce the concept of a
$\delta$-filtered cover and show that its filtered nerve is interleaved with
the \v{C}ech complex. Finally, we introduce a particular $\delta$-filtered
cover, the divisive cover. The special feature of the divisive cover is that it
is constructed top-down. If we disregard fine scale structure and $X$ is a
finite subspace of euclidean space, then we obtain a filtered simplicial
complex whose size is bounded by an upper bound independent of the cardinality
of $X$. The time needed to compute this filtered simplicial complex depends
linearly on the cardinality of $X$."@2017

$\varphi\colon B\to Y$ if the restriction of $f$ to any finite dimensional
skeleton of $X$ lifts to $B$ through $\varphi$, up to homotopy. There are two
kinds of maps which are obviously relative phantom maps: (1) the composite of a
map $X\to B$ with $\varphi$; (2) a usual phantom map $X\to Y$. A relative
phantom map of type (1) is called trivial, and a relative phantom map out of a
suspension which is a sum of (1) and (2) is called relatively trivial. We study
the (relative) triviality of relative phantom maps from a suspension, and in
particular, we give rational homotopy conditions for the (relative) triviality.
We also give a rational homotopy condition for the triviality of relative
phantom maps from a non-suspension to a finite Postnikov section."@2017

  triangulations"@Dejan Govc@"The covering type of a space $X$ is defined as the minimal cardinality of a
good cover of a space that is homotopy equivalent to $X$. We derive estimates
for the covering type of $X$ in terms of other invariants of $X$, namely the
ranks of the homology groups, the multiplicative structure of the cohomology
ring and the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $X$. By relating the covering
type to the number of vertices of minimal triangulations of complexes and
combinatorial manifolds, we obtain, within a unified framework, several
estimates which are either new or extensions of results that have been
previously obtained by ad hoc combinatorial arguments. Moreover, our methods
give results that are valid for entire homotopy classes of spaces."@2017

maps by replacing liftings to universal covering spaces by liftings with
codomain an orbit configuration space, a structure recently introduced by
Xicot\'encatl. An equivalence relation, that reduces to conjugation by covering
transformations if $n = 1$, is defined on these liftings. The number of
equivalence classes of liftings of an $n$-valued map $f$ is called the
conjugacy class number and denoted $C(f)$. The fixed point classes of $f$ are
the projections of fixed point sets of these liftings and are the same as those
of Schirmer. We relate our liftings to liftings to the universal covering
spaces and we show that in many cases they are the same. A twisted conjugacy
relation is extended from single-valued to $n$-valued maps and the number of
equivalence classes is called the Reidemeister number of $f$ and denoted
$R(f)$, as in the single-valued theory. We prove that it is related to the
conjugacy class number by the equation $C(f) = R(f)^n$. The Jiang subgroup is
extended to $n$-valued maps as a subgroup of a semidirect product and used to
find conditions under which the Nielsen number of an $n$-valued map equals its
Reidemeister number."@2017

loop space theory, which shows how to construct $G$-spectra from $G$-spaces
with suitable structure. In this paper, we construct a new variant of the
equivariant Segal machine that starts from the category $\scr{F}$ of finite
sets rather than from the category ${\scr{F}}_G$ of finite $G$-sets and which
is equivalent to the machine studied by Shimakawa and in [MMO]. In contrast to
the machine in [MMO], the new machine gives a lax symmetric monoidal functor
from the symmetric monoidal category of $\scr{F}$-$G$-spaces to the symmetric
monoidal category of orthogonal $G$-spectra. We relate it multiplicatively to
suspension $G$-spectra and to Eilenberg-MacLane $G$-spectra via lax symmetric
monoidal functors from based $G$-spaces and from abelian groups to
$\scr{F}$-$G$-spaces. Even non-equivariantly, this gives an appealing new
variant of the Segal machine. This new variant makes the equivariant
generalization of the theory essentially formal, hence is likely to be
applicable in other contexts."@2017

the complexity of algorithms for autonomous robot motion. Here, $X$ stands for
the configuration space of a system and ${\sf {TC}}(X)$ is, roughly, the
minimal number of continuous rules which are needed to construct a motion
planning algorithm in $X$. We focus on the case when the space $X$ is
aspherical; then the number ${\sf TC}(X)$ depends only on the fundamental group
$\pi=\pi_1(X)$ and we denote it ${\sf TC}(\pi)$. We prove that ${\sf TC}(\pi)$
can be characterised as the smallest integer $k$ such that the canonical
$\pi\times\pi$-equivariant map of classifying spaces $$E(\pi\times\pi) \to
E_{\mathcal D}(\pi\times\pi)$$ can be equivariantly deformed into the
$k$-dimensional skeleton of $E_{\mathcal D}(\pi\times\pi)$. The symbol
$E(\pi\times\pi)$ denotes the classifying space for free actions and
$E_{\mathcal D}(\pi\times\pi)$ denotes the classifying space for actions with
isotropy in a certain family $\mathcal D$ of subgroups of $\pi\times\pi$. Using
this result we show how one can estimate ${\sf TC}(\pi)$ in terms of the
equivariant Bredon cohomology theory. We prove that ${\sf TC}(\pi) \le \max\{3,
{\rm cd}_{\mathcal D}(\pi\times\pi)\},$ where ${\rm cd}_{\mathcal
D}(\pi\times\pi)$ denotes the cohomological dimension of $\pi\times\pi$ with
respect to the family of subgroups $\mathcal D$. We also introduce a Bredon
cohomology refinement of the canonical class and prove its universality.
Finally we show that for a large class of principal groups (which includes all
torsion free hyperbolic groups as well as all torsion free nilpotent groups)
the essential cohomology classes in the sense of Farber and Mescher are exactly
the classes having Bredon cohomology extensions with respect to the family
$\mathcal D$."@2017
