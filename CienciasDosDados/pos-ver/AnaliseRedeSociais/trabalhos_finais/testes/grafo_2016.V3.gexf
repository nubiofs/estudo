          <attvalue for="1" value="We study two methods for computing network features with topological&#10;underpinnings: the Rips and Dowker persistent homology diagrams. Our&#10;formulations work for general networks, which may be asymmetric and may have&#10;any real number as an edge weight. We study the sensitivity of Dowker&#10;persistence diagrams to asymmetry via numerous theoretical examples, including&#10;a family of highly asymmetric cycle networks that have interesting connections&#10;to the existing literature. In particular, we characterize the Dowker&#10;persistence diagrams arising from asymmetric cycle networks. We investigate the&#10;stability properties of both the Dowker and Rips persistence diagrams, and use&#10;these observations to run a classification task on a dataset comprising&#10;simulated hippocampal networks. Our theoretical and experimental results&#10;suggest that Dowker persistence diagrams are particularly suitable for studying&#10;asymmetric networks. As a stepping stone for our constructions, we prove a&#10;functorial generalization of a theorem of Dowker, after whom our constructions&#10;are named." />

The second aim is to&#10;apply this result to the $p$-local higher homotopy commutativity of gauge&#10;groups. Although the higher homotopy commutativity of Lie groups in the sense&#10;of Williams is already known, the higher homotopy commutativity in the sense of&#10;Sugawara is necessary for this application.

The main results of this paper are that&#10;$K_{-1}(E)$ vanishes when $E$ is a small stable $\infty$-category with a&#10;bounded t-structure and that $K_{-n}(E)$ vanishes for all $n\geq 1$ when&#10;additionally the heart of $E$ is noetherian. It follows that Barwick's theorem&#10;of the heart holds for nonconnective K-theory spectra when the heart is&#10;noetherian. We give several applications, to non-existence results for bounded&#10;t-structures and stability conditions, to possible K-theoretic obstructions to&#10;the existence of the motivic t-structure, and to vanishing results for the&#10;negative K-groups of a large class of dg algebras and ring spectra." />

The stable ${\mathbb Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy class&#10;of $h(F)$ is the primary obstruction to desuspending $F$ up to homotopy. The&#10;explicit nature of the construction allows for a $\pi$-equivariant version of&#10;$h(F)$ in the case of a $\pi$-equivariant $F$, with $\pi$ a discrete group. In&#10;earlier joint work we applied the $\pi_1(N)$-equivariant geometric Hopf&#10;invariant of the Umkehr map $F:\Sigma^{\infty}N^+ \to \Sigma^{\infty}T(\nu_f)$&#10;of an immersion $f:M \to N$ to capture the double points of $f$ in ${\mathbb&#10;Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory. In this manuscript we use the&#10;$\pi$-equivariant geometric Hopf invariant $h(F)$ to unify all the previous&#10;homotopy theoretic treatments of double points. Furthermore, $h(F)$ is combined&#10;with the second author's algebraic surgery theory of chain complexes with&#10;Poincar\'e duality to provide the homotopy theoretic foundations for&#10;non-simply-connected geometric surgery. For an $n$-dimensional normal map&#10;$(f,b):M \to X$ the $\pi_1(X)$-equivariant geometric Hopf invariant $h(F)$ of&#10;the Umkehr map $F:\Sigma^{\infty}X^+ \to\Sigma^{\infty}M^+$ is shown to induce&#10;the $\pi_1(X)$-equivariant quadratic structure $\psi_F$ on the chain complex&#10;kernel $C$ of $(f,b)$. Previously $\psi_F$ had only been constructed using the&#10;chain complex analogue of the functional Steenrod squares. The Wall surgery&#10;obstruction $\sigma_*(f,b)=(C,\psi_F) \in L_n({\mathbb Z}[\pi_1(X)])$ is the&#10;cobordism class of the corresponding $n$-dimensional quadratic Poincar\'e&#10;complex $(C,\psi_F)$, as in the original theory." />

Motivated by the surprising fact that Bousfield localization can destroy&#10;some of the norm maps, in previous work we studied equivariant commutative ring&#10;structures parametrized by $N_\infty$ operads.

Incomplete Tambara&#10;functors arise as $\pi_0$ of $N_\infty$ algebras, and interpolate between Green&#10;functors and Tambara functors. We classify all incomplete Tambara functors in&#10;terms of a basic structural result about polynomial functors.

The connectivity is compactly&#10;described by the persistence diagram. One limitation of the current framework&#10;is the reliance on metric distances, whereas in many practical applications&#10;objects are compared by non-metric dissimilarity measures. Examples are the&#10;Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is commonly used for comparing text and&#10;images, and the Itakura-Saito divergence, popular for speech and sound. These&#10;are two members of the broad family of dissimilarities called Bregman&#10;divergences.&#10;  We show that the framework of topological data analysis can be extended to&#10;general Bregman divergences, widening the scope of possible applications. In&#10;particular, we prove that appropriately generalized Cech and Delaunay (alpha)&#10;complexes capture the correct homotopy type, namely that of the corresponding&#10;union of Bregman balls. Consequently, their filtrations give the correct&#10;persistence diagram, namely the one generated by the uniformly growing Bregman&#10;balls. Moreover, we show that unlike the metric setting, the filtration of&#10;Vietoris-Rips complexes may fail to approximate the persistence diagram.

          <attvalue for="1" value="In topological data analysis, a point cloud data P extracted from a metric&#10;space is often analyzed by computing the persistence diagram or barcodes of a&#10;sequence of Rips complexes built on $P$ indexed by a scale parameter.&#10;Unfortunately, even for input of moderate size, the size of the Rips complex&#10;may become prohibitively large as the scale parameter increases. Starting with&#10;the Sparse Rips filtration introduced by Sheehy, some existing methods aim to&#10;reduce the size of the complex so as to improve the time efficiency as well.&#10;However, as we demonstrate, existing approaches still fall short of scaling&#10;well, especially for high dimensional data. In this paper, we investigate the&#10;advantages and limitations of existing approaches. Based on insights gained&#10;from the experiments, we propose an efficient new algorithm, called SimBa, for&#10;approximating the persistent homology of Rips filtrations with quality&#10;guarantees. Our new algorithm leverages a batch collapse strategy as well as a&#10;new sparse Rips-like filtration. We experiment on a variety of low and high&#10;dimensional data sets. We show that our strategy presents a significant size&#10;reduction, and our algorithm for approximating Rips filtration persistence is&#10;order of magnitude faster than existing methods in practice." />

This provides an abstract framework that makes certain&#10;analogies between classical and functor calculus explicit. Inspired by Huang,&#10;Marcantognini, and Young's chain rule for higher order directional derivatives&#10;of functions, we define a higher order directional derivative for functors of&#10;abelian categories. We show that our higher order directional derivative is&#10;related to the iterated partial directional derivatives of the second author&#10;and McCarthy by a Fa\`a di Bruno style formula. We obtain a higher order chain&#10;rule for our directional derivatives using a feature of the cartesian&#10;differential category structure, and with this provide a formulation for the&#10;$n$th layers of the Taylor tower of a composition of functors $F\circ G$ in&#10;terms of the derivatives and directional derivatives of $F$ and $G$,&#10;reminiscent of similar formulations for functors of spaces or spectra by Arone&#10;and Ching.

This&#10;class includes mathematical fullerenes, i.e. simple 3-polytopes with only&#10;5-gonal and 6-gonal facets. By a theorem of Pogorelov, any polytope from P&#10;admits a right-angled realisation in Lobachevsky 3-space, which is unique up to&#10;isometry.&#10;  Our families of smooth manifolds are associated with polytopes from the class&#10;P. The first family consists of 3-dimensional small covers of polytopes from P,&#10;or hyperbolic 3-manifolds of Loebell type. The second family consists of&#10;6-dimensional quasitoric manifolds over polytopes from P. Our main result is&#10;that both families are cohomologically rigid, i.e. two manifolds M and M' from&#10;either of the families are diffeomorphic if and only if their cohomology rings&#10;are isomorphic. We also prove that if M and M' are diffeomorphic, then their&#10;corresponding polytopes are combinatorially equivalent.

In this paper, we&#10;establish an analogue of this algebraic stability theorem for zigzag&#10;persistence modules. To do so, we functorially extend each zigzag persistence&#10;module to a two-dimensional persistence module, and establish an algebraic&#10;stability theorem for these extensions. One part of our argument yields a&#10;stability result for free two-dimensional persistence modules.&#10;  As an application of our main theorem, we strengthen a result of Bauer et al.&#10;on the stability of the persistent homology of Reeb graphs.

A&#10;barcode is simply a multiset of real intervals. Recent work of Edelsbrunner,&#10;Jablonski, and Mrozek suggests an equivalent description of barcodes as&#10;functors R -&gt; Mch, where R is the poset category of real numbers and Mch is the&#10;category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are matchings (i.e.,&#10;partial injective functions). Such functors form a category Mch^R whose&#10;morphisms are the natural transformations. Thus, this interpretation of&#10;barcodes gives us a hitherto unstudied categorical structure on barcodes. The&#10;aim of this note is to show that this categorical structure leads to&#10;surprisingly simple reformulations of both the well-known stability theorem for&#10;persistent homology and a recent generalization called the induced matching&#10;theorem." />

For any finite&#10;group, we prove that the assembly map for the family of cyclic subgroups is an&#10;isomorphism on homotopy groups. For infinite groups, we establish&#10;pro-isomorphism, (split) injectivity, and rational injectivity results, as well&#10;as counterexamples to injectivity and surjectivity. In particular, for&#10;hyperbolic groups and for virtually finitely generated abelian groups, we show&#10;that the assembly map for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups is injective&#10;but in general not surjective." />

This provides us with a&#10;general and flexible framework to study quantum field theories defined on&#10;spacetimes with extra geometric structures such as bundles, connections and&#10;spin structures. Using right Kan extensions, we can assign to any such theory&#10;an ordinary quantum field theory defined on the category of spacetimes and we&#10;shall clarify under which conditions it satisfies the axioms of locally&#10;covariant quantum field theory. The same constructions can be performed in a&#10;homotopy theoretic framework by using homotopy right Kan extensions, which&#10;allows us to obtain first toy-models of homotopical quantum field theories&#10;resembling some aspects of gauge theories." />

          <attvalue for="1" value="A result of Lehrer describes a beautiful relationship between topological and&#10;combinatorial data on certain families of varieties with actions of finite&#10;reflection groups. His formula relates the cohomology of complex varieties to&#10;point counts on associated varieties over finite fields. Church, Ellenberg, and&#10;Farb use their representation stability results on the cohomology of flag&#10;manifolds, together with classical results on the cohomology rings, to prove&#10;asymptotic stability for &quot;polynomial&quot; statistics on associated varieties over&#10;finite fields. In this paper we investigate the underlying algebraic structure&#10;of these families' cohomology rings that makes the formulas convergent. We&#10;prove that asymptotic stability holds in general for subquotients of&#10;FI$_\mathcal{W}$-algebras finitely generated in degree at most one, a result&#10;that is in a sense sharp. As a consequence, we obtain convergence results for&#10;polynomial statistics on the set of maximal tori in&#10;$\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\overline{F_q})$ and $\mathrm{SO}_{2n+1}(\overline{F_q})$&#10;that are invariant under the Frobenius morphism. Our results also give a new&#10;proof of the stability theorem for invariant maximal tori in&#10;$\mathrm{GL}_n(\overline{F_q})$ due to Church-Ellenberg-Farb." />

We show that the rational homology of configuration spaces of ordered&#10;particles in noncompact manifolds satisfies secondary representation stability.&#10;While representation stability for the homology of configuration spaces&#10;involves stabilizing by introducing particles near the boundary, secondary&#10;representation stability involves stabilizing by introducing pairs of orbiting&#10;particles. This result can be thought of as a representation-theoretic analogue&#10;of secondary homological stability in the sense of Galatius, Kupers, and&#10;Randal-Williams. In the course of the proof we establish some additional&#10;results: we give a new characterization of the integral homology of the complex&#10;of injective words, and we give a new proof of integral representation&#10;stability for configuration spaces of noncompact manifolds, extending previous&#10;results to nonorientable manifolds. In an appendix, we use results on&#10;FI-homology to give explicit stable ranges for the integral cohomology of&#10;configuration spaces of closed manifolds." />
