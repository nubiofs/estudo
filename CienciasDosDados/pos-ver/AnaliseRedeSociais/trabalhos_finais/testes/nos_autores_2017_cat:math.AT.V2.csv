pseudomanifolds, and to give a positive answer to a conjecture of M. Goresky

  In this paper, we establish the main properties of this cohomology. One of
its major feature is the existence of cap and cup products for any filtered
space and any commutative ring of coefficients, at the cochain level. Moreover,
we show that each stratified map induces an homomorphism between the blown-up
intersection cohomologies, compatible with the cup and cap products. We prove
also its topological invariance in the case of a pseudomanifold with no
codimension one strata. Finally, we compare it with the intersection cohomology

homology that performs well at large filtration values. To this end we
introduce the concept of filtered covers. We show that the persistent homology
of a bounded metric space obtained from the \v{C}ech complex is the persistent
homology of the filtered nerve of the filtered \v{C}ech cover. Given a
parameter $\delta$ with $0 < \delta \le 1$ we introduce the concept of a
$\delta$-filtered cover and show that its filtered nerve is interleaved with
the \v{C}ech complex. Finally, we introduce a particular $\delta$-filtered
cover, the divisive cover. The special feature of the divisive cover is that it
is constructed top-down. If we disregard fine scale structure and $X$ is a
finite subspace of euclidean space, then we obtain a filtered simplicial
complex whose size is bounded by an upper bound independent of the cardinality
of $X$. The time needed to compute this filtered simplicial complex depends
linearly on the cardinality of $X$."@2017

Ulrik Buchholtz@http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05770v1@The real projective spaces in homotopy type theory@"Homotopy type theory is a version of Martin-L\""of type theory taking
advantage of its homotopical models. In particular, we can use and construct
objects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types.
In this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in
homotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The
classical definition of RP(n), as the quotient space identifying antipodal
points of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory.
Instead, we define RP(n) by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological
bundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take RP(-1) to be the empty
type. In the inductive step, we take RP(n+1) to be the mapping cone of the
projection map of the tautological bundle of RP(n), and we use its universal
property and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on RP(n+1).
  By showing that the total space of the tautological bundle of RP(n) is the
n-sphere, we retrieve the classical description of RP(n+1) as RP(n) with an
(n+1)-cell attached to it. The infinite dimensional real projective space,
defined as the sequential colimit of the RP(n) with the canonical inclusion
maps, is equivalent to the Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z/2Z,1), which here arises
as the subtype of the universe consisting of 2-element types. Indeed, the
infinite dimensional projective space classifies the 0-sphere bundles, which
one can think of as synthetic line bundles.
  These constructions in homotopy type theory further illustrate the utility of
homotopy type theory, including the interplay of type theoretic and homotopy
theoretic ideas."@2017

is solvable and give a characterization for it to be abelian. We further prove

P. Christopher Staecker@http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02722v2@Lifting classes for the fixed point theory of $n$-valued maps@"The theory of lifting classes of single-valued maps is extended to $n$-valued
maps by replacing liftings to universal covering spaces by liftings with
codomain an orbit configuration space, a structure recently introduced by
Xicot\'encatl. An equivalence relation, that reduces to conjugation by covering
transformations if $n = 1$, is defined on these liftings. The number of
equivalence classes of liftings of an $n$-valued map $f$ is called the
conjugacy class number and denoted $C(f)$. The fixed point classes of $f$ are
the projections of fixed point sets of these liftings and are the same as those
of Schirmer. We relate our liftings to liftings to the universal covering
spaces and we show that in many cases they are the same. A twisted conjugacy
relation is extended from single-valued to $n$-valued maps and the number of
equivalence classes is called the Reidemeister number of $f$ and denoted
$R(f)$, as in the single-valued theory. We prove that it is related to the
conjugacy class number by the equation $C(f) = R(f)^n$. The Jiang subgroup is
extended to $n$-valued maps as a subgroup of a semidirect product and used to
find conditions under which the Nielsen number of an $n$-valued map equals its
Reidemeister number."@2017

prove that the \'Alvarez classes of the strata can be glued in a unique global

Patrizio Frosini@http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07893v2@The Persistent Homotopy Type Distance@"We introduce the persistent homotopy type distance dHT to compare real valued
functions defined on possibly different homotopy equivalent topological spaces.
The underlying idea in the definition of dHT is to measure the minimal shift
that is necessary to apply to one of the two functions in order that the
sublevel sets of the two functions become homotopically equivalent. This
distance is interesting in connection with persistent homology. Indeed, our
main result states that dHT still provides an upper bound for the bottleneck
distance between the persistence diagrams of the intervening functions.
Moreover, because homotopy equivalences are weaker than homeomorphisms, this
implies a lifting of the standard stability results provided by the L-infty
distance and the natural pseudo-distance dNP. From a different standpoint, we
prove that dHT extends the L-infty distance and dNP in two ways. First, we show
that, appropriately restricting the category of objects to which dHT applies,
it can be made to coincide with the other two distances. Finally, we show that
dHT has an interpretation in terms of interleavings that naturally places it in
the family of distances used in persistence theory."@2017

Steve Oudot@http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02901v1@Local Equivalence and Intrinsic Metrics between Reeb Graphs@"As graphical summaries for topological spaces and maps, Reeb graphs are
common objects in the computer graphics or topological data analysis
literature. Defining good metrics between these objects has become an important
question for applications, where it matters to quantify the extent by which two
given Reeb graphs differ. Recent contributions emphasize this aspect, proposing
novel distances such as {\em functional distortion} or {\em interleaving} that
are provably more discriminative than the so-called {\em bottleneck distance},
being true metrics whereas the latter is only a pseudo-metric. Their main
drawback compared to the bottleneck distance is to be comparatively hard (if at
all possible) to evaluate. Here we take the opposite view on the problem and
show that the bottleneck distance is in fact good enough {\em locally}, in the
sense that it is able to discriminate a Reeb graph from any other Reeb graph in
a small enough neighborhood, as efficiently as the other metrics do. This
suggests considering the {\em intrinsic metrics} induced by these distances,
which turn out to be all {\em globally} equivalent. This novel viewpoint on the
study of Reeb graphs has a potential impact on applications, where one may not
only be interested in discriminating between data but also in interpolating
between them."@2017

existence of model category structure on categories of coalgebras over comonads

the tangent space at $x_0$. The group $\mathrm{Diff}_{x_0}(M)$ acts freely on

over the classic moduli space, which is the quotient by the full diffeomorphism
group. Results due to Botvinnik, Hanke, Schick and Walsh, and to Hanke, Schick
and Steimle have demonstrated that the higher homotopy groups of the observer
moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{x_0}^{s>0}(M)$ of positive scalar curvature metrics

similar results for the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{x_0}^{\mathrm{Ric}>0}(M)$ of

complicated shapes. PDs enjoy strong stability properties and have proven their
utility in various learning contexts. They do not, however, live in a space
naturally endowed with a Hilbert structure and are usually compared with
specific distances, such as the bottleneck distance. To incorporate PDs in a
learning pipeline, several kernels have been proposed for PDs with a strong
emphasis on the stability of the RKHS distance w.r.t. perturbations of the PDs.
In this article, we use the Sliced Wasserstein approximation SW of the
Wasserstein distance to define a new kernel for PDs, which is not only provably
stable but also provably discriminative (depending on the number of points in
the PDs) w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance $d_1$ between PDs. We also demonstrate
its practicality, by developing an approximation technique to reduce kernel
computation time, and show that our proposal compares favorably to existing
kernels for PDs on several benchmarks."@2017

paper proposes a kernel method on persistence diagrams. A theoretical
contribution of our method is that the proposed kernel allows one to control
the effect of persistence, and, if necessary, noisy topological properties can
be discounted in data analysis. Furthermore, the method provides a fast
approximation technique. The method is applied into several problems including

characterizing multiscale topological features in data. When many datasets are
available, statistical features embedded in those persistence diagrams can be
extracted by applying machine learnings. In particular, the ability for
explicitly analyzing the inverse in the original data space from those
statistical features of persistence diagrams is significantly important for
practical applications. In this paper, we propose a unified method for the
inverse analysis by combining linear machine learning models with persistence

specialize to the $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ model. Because of the Hopf map
$\pi_3(\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1)=\mathbb{Z}$ one might try to couple the model to
a periodic $\theta$ parameter. However, we argue that only the values
$\theta=0$ and $\theta=\pi$ are consistent. For these values the Skyrmions in
the model are bosons and fermions respectively, rather than being anyons. We
also extend the model by coupling it to a topological quantum field theory,
such that the Skyrmions are anyons. We use techniques from geometry and
topology to construct the $\theta =\pi $ theory on arbitrary 3-manifolds, and
use recent results about invertible field theories to prove that no other

topological data analysis. In this paper, we provide bounds on the
computational complexity of determining the interleaving distance in several
settings. We show that the interleaving distance is NP-hard to compute for
persistence modules valued in the category of vector spaces. In the specific
setting of multidimensional persistent homology we show that the problem is at
least as hard as a matrix invertibility problem. Furthermore, this allows us to
conclude that the interleaving distance of interval decomposable modules
depends on the characteristic of the field. Persistence modules valued in the
category of sets are also studied. As a corollary, we obtain that the

We have developed a topology-based analysis tool called Two-Tier Mapper (TTMap)

each test sample from the control group in a high-dimensional space is computed

sensitivity and stability; clustering is not affected by removal of samples
from the control group, choice of normalization nor subselection of data. There
is no user induced bias because all parameters are data-driven. Datasets can
readily be combined into one analysis. TTMap reveals hitherto undetected gene
expression changes in mouse mammary glands related to hormonal changes during
the estrous cycle. This illustrates the ability to extract information from

operations. On the other hand, we give examples to show that monoidal
equivalences do not have to preserve the second Adams operations and to show
that monoidal equivalences that preserve the second Adams operations do not
