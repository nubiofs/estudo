http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03009v2@David Chataur@Intersection Homology. General perversities and topological invariance@"Topological invariance of the intersection homology of a pseudomanifold
without codimension one strata, proven by Goresky and MacPherson, is one of the
main features of this homology. This property is true for strata codimension
depending perversities with some growth conditions, verifying $\overline
p(1)=\overline p(2)=0$. King reproves this invariance by associating an
intrinsic pseudomanifold $X^*$ to any pseudomanifold $X$. His proof consists of
an isomorphism between the associated intersection homologies
$H^{\overline{p}}_{*}(X) \cong H^{\overline{p}}_{*}(X^*)$ for any perversity
$\overline{p}$ with the same growth conditions verifying $\overline p(1)\geq
0$.
  In this work, we prove a certain topological invariance within the framework
of strata depending perversities, $\overline{p}$, which corresponds to the
classical topological invariance if $\overline{p}$ is a GM-perversity. We also
extend it to the tame intersection homology, a variation of the intersection
homology, particularly suited for ""large"" perversities, if there is no singular
strata on $X$ becoming regular in $X^*$. In particular, under the above
conditions, the intersection homology and the tame intersection homology are
invariant under a refinement of the stratification."@2016

http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01118v1@David Gepner@Brauer groups and Galois cohomology of commutative ring spectra@"In this paper we develop methods for classifying Baker-Richter-Szymik's
Azumaya algebras over a commutative ring spectrum, especially in the largely
inaccessible case where the ring is nonconnective. We give
obstruction-theoretic tools, constructing and classifying these algebras and
their automorphisms with Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory, and give
descent-theoretic tools, applying Lurie's work on $\infty$-categories to show
that a finite Galois extension of rings in the sense of Rognes becomes a
homotopy fixed-point equivalence on Brauer spaces.
  For even-periodic ring spectra $E$, we find that the ""algebraic"" Azumaya
algebras whose coefficient ring is projective are governed by the Brauer-Wall
group of $\pi_0(E)$, recovering a result of Baker-Richter-Szymik. This allows
us to calculate many examples. For example, we find that the algebraic Azumaya
algebras over Lubin-Tate spectra have either 4 or 2 Morita equivalence classes
depending on whether the prime is odd or even, that all algebraic Azumaya
algebras over the complex K-theory spectrum $KU$ are Morita trivial, and that
the group of the Morita classes of algebraic Azumaya algebras over the
localization $KU[1/2]$ is $\Bbb Z/8 \times \Bbb Z/2$.
  Using our descent results and an obstruction theory spectral sequence, we
also study Azumaya algebras over the real K-theory spectrum $KO$ which become

http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01118v1@Tyler Lawson@Brauer groups and Galois cohomology of commutative ring spectra@"In this paper we develop methods for classifying Baker-Richter-Szymik's
Azumaya algebras over a commutative ring spectrum, especially in the largely
inaccessible case where the ring is nonconnective. We give
obstruction-theoretic tools, constructing and classifying these algebras and
their automorphisms with Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory, and give
descent-theoretic tools, applying Lurie's work on $\infty$-categories to show
that a finite Galois extension of rings in the sense of Rognes becomes a
homotopy fixed-point equivalence on Brauer spaces.
  For even-periodic ring spectra $E$, we find that the ""algebraic"" Azumaya
algebras whose coefficient ring is projective are governed by the Brauer-Wall
group of $\pi_0(E)$, recovering a result of Baker-Richter-Szymik. This allows
us to calculate many examples. For example, we find that the algebraic Azumaya
algebras over Lubin-Tate spectra have either 4 or 2 Morita equivalence classes
depending on whether the prime is odd or even, that all algebraic Azumaya
algebras over the complex K-theory spectrum $KU$ are Morita trivial, and that
the group of the Morita classes of algebraic Azumaya algebras over the
localization $KU[1/2]$ is $\Bbb Z/8 \times \Bbb Z/2$.
  Using our descent results and an obstruction theory spectral sequence, we
also study Azumaya algebras over the real K-theory spectrum $KO$ which become
Morita-trivial $KU$-algebras. We show that there exist exactly two Morita
equivalence classes of these. The nontrivial Morita equivalence class is
