http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06618v1@"Operad bimodules, and composition products on Andre-Quillen filtrations
  of algebras"@['Nicholas J. Kuhn', 'Luis A. Pereira']@"If O is a reduced operad in symmetric spectra, an O-algebra I can be viewed
as analogous to the augmentation ideal of an augmented algebra. Implicit in the
literature on Topological Andre-Quillen homology is that such an I admits a
canonical (and homotopically meaningful) decreasing O-algebra filtration I >
I^2 > I^3 > ... satisfying various nice properties analogous to powers of an
ideal in a ring.
  In this paper, we are explicit about these constructions. With R a
commutative S-algebra, we study derived versions of the circle product M o_O I,
where M is an O-bimodule, and I is an O-algebra in R-modules. Letting M run
through a decreasing O-bimodule filtration of O itself then yields the
augmentation ideal filtration as above. The composition structure of the operad
induces algebra maps from (I^i)^j to I^{ij}, fitting nicely with previously
studied structure.
  As a formal consequence, an O-algebra map from I to J^d induces compatible
maps from I^n to J^{dn}, for all n. This is an essential tool in the first
author's study of Hurewicz maps for infinite loop spaces, and its utility is
illustrated here with a lifting theorem."@2016

established so that the non-vanishing of a Lefschetz type coincidence class
$L(f_1,...,f_k)$ implies the existence of a coincidence $x\in X$ such that
$f_1(x)=...=f_k(x)$. In this paper, we investigate the converse of the
Lefschetz coincidence theorem for multiple maps. In particular, we study the
obstruction to deforming the maps $f_1,...,f_k$ to be coincidence free. We
construct an example of two maps $f_1,f_2:M\to T$ from a sympletic $4$-manifold
$M$ to the $2$-torus $T$ such that $f_1$ and $f_2$ cannot be homotopic to

http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08247v1@Permutahedral Structures of $E_2$ Operads@['Ralph M. Kaufmann', 'Yongheng Zhang']@"There are basically two interesting breeds of $E_2$ operads, those that
detect loop spaces and those that solve Deligne's conjecture. The former
deformation retract to Milgram's space obtained by gluing together permutahedra
at their faces. We show how the second breed can be covered by permutahedra as
well. Even more is true, the quotient is actually already an operad up to
homotopy, which induces the operad structure on cellular chains adapted to
prove Deligne's conjecture, while no such structure is known on Milgram's
space. We show, explicitely, that these two quotients are homotopy equivalent.
This gives a new topological proof that operads of this type are indeed of the
right homotopy type. It also furnishes a very nice clean description in terms
of polyhedra, and with it PL topology, for the whole story. The permutahedra
and partial orders play a central role. This, in turn, provides direct links to
other fields of mathematics. We for instance find a new cellular decomposition
of permutahedra using partial orders and that the permutahedra give the cells
for the Dyer--Lashof operations."@2016
http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00047v2@Strictly commutative complex orientation theory@['Michael J. Hopkins', 'Tyler Lawson']@"For a multiplicative cohomology theory E, complex orientations are in
bijective correspondence with multiplicative natural transformations to E from
complex bordism cohomology MU. If E is represented by a spectrum with a highly
structured multiplication, we give an iterative process for lifting an
orientation MU -> E to a map respecting this extra structure, based on work of
Arone-Lesh. The space of strictly commutative orientations is the limit of an
inverse tower of spaces parametrizing partial lifts; stage 1 corresponds to
ordinary complex orientations, and lifting from stage (m-1) to stage m is
governed by the existence of a orientation for a family of E-modules over a
fixed base space F_m.
  When E is p-local, we can say more. We find that this tower only changes when
m is a power of p, and if E is E(n)-local the tower is constant after stage
p^n. Moreover, if the coefficient ring E^* is p-torsion free, the ability to
lift from stage 1 to stage p is equivalent to a condition on the associated
formal group law that was shown necessary by Ando."@2016

MacPherson. On one side of the equivalence is the category of cosheaves that
are constructible with respect to a topological stratification. Our
constructibility condition is new and only requires that certain inclusions of

category of functors from the entrance path category, which has points for
objects and certain homotopy classes of paths for morphisms. When our
constructible cosheaves are valued in Set we prove an additional equivalence
with the category of stratified coverings. Finally, we provide a combinatorial
description of the entrance path category and stratified coverings when the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02066v2@On the symmetric squares of complex and quaternionic projective space@['Yumi Boote', 'Nigel Ray']@"The problem of computing the integral cohomology ring of the symmetric square
of a topological space has been of interest since the 1930s, but limited
progress has been made on the general case until recently. In this work we
offer a solution for the complex and quaternionic projective spaces $KP^n$, by
taking advantage of their rich geometrical structure. Our description is in
terms of generators and relations, and our methods entail ideas that have
appeared in the literature of quantum chemistry, theoretical physics, and
combinatorics. We deal first with the case $KP^\infty$, and proceed by
identifying the truncation required for passage to finite n. The calculations
rely upon a ladder of long exact cohomology sequences, which arises by
comparing cofibrations associated to the diagonals of the symmetric square and
the corresponding Borel construction. The cofibrations involve classic
configuration spaces of unordered pairs of 1-dimensional subspaces of
$K^{n+1}$, and their one-point compactifications; the latter are identified as
Thom spaces by combining Lowdin's symmetric orthogonalisation process (and its
quaternionic extension) with a dash of Pin geometry. The ensuing integral
cohomology rings may be conveniently expressed using generalised Fibonacci
polynomials. By way of validation, we note that our conclusions are compatible
with mod 2 computations of Nakaoka and with homological results of Milgram."@2016

Azumaya algebras over a commutative ring spectrum, especially in the largely
inaccessible case where the ring is nonconnective. We give
obstruction-theoretic tools, constructing and classifying these algebras and
their automorphisms with Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory, and give
descent-theoretic tools, applying Lurie's work on $\infty$-categories to show
that a finite Galois extension of rings in the sense of Rognes becomes a
homotopy fixed-point equivalence on Brauer spaces.
  For even-periodic ring spectra $E$, we find that the ""algebraic"" Azumaya
algebras whose coefficient ring is projective are governed by the Brauer-Wall
group of $\pi_0(E)$, recovering a result of Baker-Richter-Szymik. This allows
us to calculate many examples. For example, we find that the algebraic Azumaya
algebras over Lubin-Tate spectra have either 4 or 2 Morita equivalence classes
depending on whether the prime is odd or even, that all algebraic Azumaya
algebras over the complex K-theory spectrum $KU$ are Morita trivial, and that
the group of the Morita classes of algebraic Azumaya algebras over the
localization $KU[1/2]$ is $\Bbb Z/8 \times \Bbb Z/2$.
  Using our descent results and an obstruction theory spectral sequence, we
also study Azumaya algebras over the real K-theory spectrum $KO$ which become
Morita-trivial $KU$-algebras. We show that there exist exactly two Morita
equivalence classes of these. The nontrivial Morita equivalence class is
realized by an ""exotic"" $KO$-algebra with the same coefficient ring as
$End_{KO}(KU)$. This requires a careful analysis of what happens in the
homotopy fixed-point spectral sequence for the Picard space of $KU$, previously
studied by Mathew and Stojanoska."@2016

for Poincar\'e duality complexes of dimension $3$ (PD$_{3}$-complexes)
generalize to PD$_{n}$-complexes with $(n-2)$-connected universal cover for $n
\ge 3$. Baues and Bleile showed that such complexes are classified, up to
oriented homotopy equivalence, by the triple consisting of their fundamental
group, orientation class and the image of their fundamental class in the
homology of the fundamental group, verifying Turaev's conjecture on
classification.
  We prove Turaev's conjectures on realization and splitting. We show that a
triple $(G, \omega, \mu)$, comprising a group, $G$, a cohomology class $\omega
\in H^{1}\left(G, \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\right)$ and a homology class $\mu \in
H_{n}(G, \mathbb{Z}^{\omega})$, can be realized by a PD$_{n}$-complex with
$(n-2)$-connected universal cover if and only if the Turaev map applied to
$\mu$ yields is an equivalence. We show that such a PD$_{n}$-complex is a
connected sum of two such complexes if and only if its fundamental group is a
free product of groups.
  We then consider the indecomposable $PD_n$-complexes of this type. When $n$
is odd the results are similar to those for the case $n=3$. The indecomposables
are either aspherical or have virtually free fundamental group. When $n$ is

have virtually free fundamental group, but if the group is virtually free and

admits a stable classifying space for proper actions that is finite or of
finite type and relate these conditions to the compactness of the sphere
spectrum in the homotopy category of proper $G$-spectra and to classical
finiteness properties of the Weyl groups of finite subgroups of $G$. Finally,
if the group $G$ is virtually torsion-free we also show that the smallest

encoding the flow data associated to a Floer functional. A framed flow category
gives rise to a CW-complex with one cell for each object of the category. The
idea is that the Floer invariant should take the form of the stable homotopy
type of the resulting complex, recovering the Floer cohomology as its singular
cohomology. Such a framed flow category was produced, for example, by
Lipshitz-Sarkar from the input of a knot diagram, resulting in a stable
homotopy type generalizing Khovanov cohomology.
  In this paper we give moves that change a framed flow category without
changing the associated stable homotopy type. These are inspired by moves that
can be performed in the Morse-Smale case without altering the underlying smooth
manifold. We posit that if two framed flow categories represent the same stable
homotopy type then a finite sequence of these moves is sufficient to connect
the two categories. This is directed towards the goal of reducing the study of
framed flow categories to a combinatorial calculus.
  We provide examples of calculations performed with these moves (related to
the Khovanov framed flow category), and prove some general results about the

a rich algebraic structure known as a Tambara functor. This algebraic structure
mirrors the structure on $R$ arising from the existence of multiplicative norm
maps. Motivated by the surprising fact that Bousfield localization can destroy
some of the norm maps, in previous work we studied equivariant commutative ring
structures parametrized by $N_\infty$ operads. In a precise sense, these
interpolate between ""naive"" and ""genuine"" equivariant ring structures.
  In this paper, we describe the algebraic analogue of $N_\infty$ ring
structures. We introduce and study categories of incomplete Tambara functors,
described in terms of certain categories of bispans. Incomplete Tambara
functors arise as $\pi_0$ of $N_\infty$ algebras, and interpolate between Green
functors and Tambara functors. We classify all incomplete Tambara functors in
terms of a basic structural result about polynomial functors. This
classification gives a conceptual justification for our prior description of
$N_\infty$ operads and also allows us to easily describe the properties of the

on the multidimensional matching distance. While this metric is rather simple
to define and compute by considering a suitable family of filtering functions
associated with lines having a positive slope, it has two main drawbacks.
First, it forgets the natural link between the homological properties of
filtrations associated with lines that are close to each other. As a
consequence, part of the interesting homological information is lost. Second,
its intrinsically discontinuous definition makes it difficult to study its
properties. In this paper we introduce a new matching distance for 2D
persistent Betti numbers, called coherent matching distance and based on
matchings that change coherently with the filtrations we take into account. Its
definition is not trivial, as it must face the presence of monodromy in
multidimensional persistence, i.e. the fact that different paths in the space
parameterizing the above filtrations can induce different matchings between the
associated persistent diagrams. In our paper we prove that the coherent 2D
matching distance is well-defined and stable."@2016

hierarchical clustering using a 1-parameter family of homology groups to
quantify connectivity in all dimensions. The connectivity is compactly
described by the persistence diagram. One limitation of the current framework
is the reliance on metric distances, whereas in many practical applications
objects are compared by non-metric dissimilarity measures. Examples are the
Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is commonly used for comparing text and
images, and the Itakura-Saito divergence, popular for speech and sound. These
are two members of the broad family of dissimilarities called Bregman
divergences.
  We show that the framework of topological data analysis can be extended to
general Bregman divergences, widening the scope of possible applications. In
particular, we prove that appropriately generalized Cech and Delaunay (alpha)
complexes capture the correct homotopy type, namely that of the corresponding
union of Bregman balls. Consequently, their filtrations give the correct
persistence diagram, namely the one generated by the uniformly growing Bregman
balls. Moreover, we show that unlike the metric setting, the filtration of
Vietoris-Rips complexes may fail to approximate the persistence diagram. We
propose algorithms to compute the thus generalized Cech, Vietoris-Rips and
Delaunay complexes and experimentally test their efficiency. Lastly, we explain
their surprisingly good performance by making a connection with discrete Morse

reduce the size of the complex so as to improve the time efficiency as well.
However, as we demonstrate, existing approaches still fall short of scaling
well, especially for high dimensional data. In this paper, we investigate the
advantages and limitations of existing approaches. Based on insights gained
from the experiments, we propose an efficient new algorithm, called SimBa, for
approximating the persistent homology of Rips filtrations with quality
guarantees. Our new algorithm leverages a batch collapse strategy as well as a

that for fixed $m$ and $n$, the answer is at worst quadratic in $L$. More

the Bj\""orner--Wachs theory of lexicographic shellability from algebraic

equivalence relation generated by isotopy and embedded connected sum with
embeddings $S^4\to R^7$. Such a classification was already known when $H_1=0$

are of essential importance in the conceptualization of molecular structure,

molecular surface and structural representation, and offers the basis for
molecular visualization, which is crucial for the understanding of molecular
structure and interactions. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between
molecular structural data and theoretical/mathematical models. Topological
analysis and modeling give rise to atomic critical points and connectivity, and
shed light on the intrinsic topological invariants such as independent
components (atoms), rings (pockets) and cavities. Graph theory analyzes
biomolecular interactions and reveals biomolecular structure-function
relationship. In this paper, we review certain geometric, topological and graph
theory apparatuses for biomolecular data modeling and analysis. These
apparatuses are categorized into discrete and continuous ones. For discrete
approaches, graph theory, Gaussian network model, anisotropic network model,
