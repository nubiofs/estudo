underpinnings: the Rips and Dowker persistent homology diagrams. Our
formulations work for general networks, which may be asymmetric and may have
any real number as an edge weight. We study the sensitivity of Dowker
persistence diagrams to asymmetry via numerous theoretical examples, including
a family of highly asymmetric cycle networks that have interesting connections
to the existing literature. In particular, we characterize the Dowker
persistence diagrams arising from asymmetric cycle networks. We investigate the
stability properties of both the Dowker and Rips persistence diagrams, and use
these observations to run a classification task on a dataset comprising
simulated hippocampal networks. Our theoretical and experimental results
suggest that Dowker persistence diagrams are particularly suitable for studying
asymmetric networks. As a stepping stone for our constructions, we prove a
functorial generalization of a theorem of Dowker, after whom our constructions

without codimension one strata, proven by Goresky and MacPherson, is one of the
main features of this homology. This property is true for strata codimension
depending perversities with some growth conditions, verifying $\overline
p(1)=\overline p(2)=0$. King reproves this invariance by associating an
intrinsic pseudomanifold $X^*$ to any pseudomanifold $X$. His proof consists of
an isomorphism between the associated intersection homologies

http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08198v2@Roman Mikhailov@On lengths of HZ-localization towers@"In this paper, the $H\mathbb Z$-length of different groups is studied. By
definition, this is the length of $H\mathbb Z$-localization tower or the length
of transfinite lower central series of $H\mathbb Z$-localization. It is proved
that, for a free noncyclic group, its $H\mathbb Z$-length is $\geq \omega+2$.
For a large class of $\mathbb Z[C]$-modules $M,$ where $C$ is an infinite
cyclic group, it is proved that the $H\mathbb Z$-length of the semi-direct
product $M\rtimes C$ is $\leq \omega+1$ and its $H\mathbb Z$-localization can
be described as a central extension of its pro-nilpotent completion. In
particular, this class covers modules $M$, such that $M\rtimes C$ is finitely
presented and $H_2(M\rtimes C)$ is finite."@2016

readily calculable classification of embeddings $N\to R^7$ up to isotopy, with
an indeterminancy. Such a classification was only known before for $H_1=0$ by
our earlier work from 2008. Our classification is complete when $H_2=0$ or when
the signature of $N$ is divisible neither by 64 nor by 9.
  The group of knots $S^4\to R^7$ acts on the set of embeddings $N\to R^7$ up

configuration spaces for particles on one-connected graphs. In particular, we
compute the homology groups over integers for different classes of

properties of the configuration spaces, Mayer-Vietoris sequences for different
parts of configuration spaces and some limited use of discrete Morse theory. As
one of the results, we derive a closed-form formulae for ranks of the homology
groups for indistinguishable particles on tree graphs. We also give a detailed

of the Kan condition for simplicial sets. An explicit construction of Henriques
produces certain Lie $\infty$-groupoids called `Lie $\infty$-groups' by
integrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility
between this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras
introduced in the companion paper arXiv:1809.05999, we present a homotopy
theory for Lie $\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher
geometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\infty$-groupoids do not form
a category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks
pullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete
category of fibrant objects' in which the weak equivalences correspond to
`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure
enjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of
functorial path objects, a convenient realization of its simplicial
localization. We further prove that the acyclic fibrations are precisely the
hypercovers, which implies that many of Behrend and Getzler's results also hold
in this more general context. As an application, we show that Henriques'
integration functor is an exact functor with respect to a class of

  Theorem"@"Persistent homology, a central tool of topological data analysis, provides
invariants of data called barcodes (also known as persistence diagrams). A
barcode is simply a multiset of real intervals. Recent work of Edelsbrunner,
Jablonski, and Mrozek suggests an equivalent description of barcodes as
functors R -> Mch, where R is the poset category of real numbers and Mch is the
category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are matchings (i.e.,
partial injective functions). Such functors form a category Mch^R whose
morphisms are the natural transformations. Thus, this interpretation of
barcodes gives us a hitherto unstudied categorical structure on barcodes. The
aim of this note is to show that this categorical structure leads to
surprisingly simple reformulations of both the well-known stability theorem for

presence of localised matter states from wrapped M2-branes which are not
charged under any massless gauge potential. We identify a class of $\mathbb
Q$-factorial terminal singularities on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau
threefolds for which we can compute the number of uncharged localised
hypermultiplets in terms of their associated Milnor numbers. These count the
local complex deformations of the singularities. The resulting six-dimensional
spectra are shown to be anomaly-free. We exemplify this in a variety of cases,
including models with non-perturbative gauge groups with both charged and
uncharged localised matter. The underlying mathematics will be discussed
further in a forthcoming publication."@2016
