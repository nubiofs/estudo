underpinnings: the Rips and Dowker persistent homology diagrams. Our
formulations work for general networks, which may be asymmetric and may have
any real number as an edge weight. We study the sensitivity of Dowker
persistence diagrams to asymmetry via numerous theoretical examples, including
a family of highly asymmetric cycle networks that have interesting connections
to the existing literature. In particular, we characterize the Dowker
persistence diagrams arising from asymmetric cycle networks. We investigate the
stability properties of both the Dowker and Rips persistence diagrams, and use
these observations to run a classification task on a dataset comprising
simulated hippocampal networks. Our theoretical and experimental results
suggest that Dowker persistence diagrams are particularly suitable for studying
asymmetric networks. As a stepping stone for our constructions, we prove a

  Using our descent results and an obstruction theory spectral sequence, we
also study Azumaya algebras over the real K-theory spectrum $KO$ which become
Morita-trivial $KU$-algebras. We show that there exist exactly two Morita
equivalence classes of these. The nontrivial Morita equivalence class is
realized by an ""exotic"" $KO$-algebra with the same coefficient ring as
$End_{KO}(KU)$. This requires a careful analysis of what happens in the
homotopy fixed-point spectral sequence for the Picard space of $KU$, previously
studied by Mathew and Stojanoska."@2016

to define and compute by considering a suitable family of filtering functions
associated with lines having a positive slope, it has two main drawbacks.
First, it forgets the natural link between the homological properties of
filtrations associated with lines that are close to each other. As a
consequence, part of the interesting homological information is lost. Second,
its intrinsically discontinuous definition makes it difficult to study its
properties. In this paper we introduce a new matching distance for 2D
persistent Betti numbers, called coherent matching distance and based on
matchings that change coherently with the filtrations we take into account. Its
definition is not trivial, as it must face the presence of monodromy in
multidimensional persistence, i.e. the fact that different paths in the space
parameterizing the above filtrations can induce different matchings between the
associated persistent diagrams. In our paper we prove that the coherent 2D
matching distance is well-defined and stable."@2016

use it to construct a wealth of explicit nontrivial elements in these

integrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility
between this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras

theory for Lie $\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher
geometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\infty$-groupoids do not form
a category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks
pullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete

`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure
enjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of

charged under any massless gauge potential. We identify a class of $\mathbb

hypermultiplets in terms of their associated Milnor numbers. These count the
local complex deformations of the singularities. The resulting six-dimensional

concept of topological stability results in a simple method for estimating the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00196v2@Ralph M. Kaufmann@"Three Hopf algebras and their common simplicial and categorical
  background"@"We consider three a priori totally different setups for Hopf algebras from
number theory, mathematical physics and algebraic topology. These are the Hopf
algebras of Goncharov for multiple zeta values, that of Connes--Kreimer for
renormalization, and a Hopf algebra constructed by Baues to study double loop
spaces. We show that these examples can be successively unified by considering
simplicial objects, cooperads with multiplication and Feynman categories at the
ultimate level. These considerations open the door to new constructions and
reinterpretation of known constructions in a large common framework."@2016
