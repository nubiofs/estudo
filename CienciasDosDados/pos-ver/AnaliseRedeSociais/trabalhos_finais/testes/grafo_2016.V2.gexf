          <attvalue for="1" value="A homotopical treatment of intersection cohomology recently developed by&#10;Chataur-Saralegui-Tanr\'e associates a &quot;perverse algebraic model&quot; to every&#10;topological pseudomanifold, extending Sullivan's presentation of rational&#10;homotopy to intersection cohomology. In this context, there is a notion of&#10;&quot;intersection-formality&quot;, measuring the vanishing of Massey products in&#10;intersection cohomology. In the present paper, we study the perverse algebraic&#10;model of complex projective varieties with isolated singularities. We endow&#10;such invariant with natural mixed Hodge structures. This allows us to prove&#10;some intersection-formality results for large families of complex projective&#10;varieties, such as isolated surface singularities and varieties of arbitrary&#10;dimension with ordinary isolated singularities." />

          <attvalue for="1" value="For having a Poincar\'e duality via a cap product between the intersection&#10;homology of a paracompact oriented pseudomanifold and the cohomology given by&#10;the dual complex, G. Friedman and J. E. McClure need a coefficient field or an&#10;additional hypothesis on the torsion. In this work, by using the classical&#10;geometric process of blowing-up, adapted to a simplicial setting, we build a&#10;cochain complex which gives a Poincar\'e duality via a cap product with&#10;intersection homology, for any commutative ring of coefficients. We prove also&#10;the topological invariance of the blown-up intersection cohomology with compact&#10;supports in the case of a paracompact pseudomanifold with no codimension one&#10;strata.&#10;  This work is written with general perversities, defined on each stratum and&#10;not only in function of the codimension of strata. It contains also a tame&#10;intersection homology, suitable for large perversities." />

If E is represented by a spectrum with a highly&#10;structured multiplication, we give an iterative process for lifting an&#10;orientation MU -&gt; E to a map respecting this extra structure, based on work of&#10;Arone-Lesh. The space of strictly commutative orientations is the limit of an&#10;inverse tower of spaces parametrizing partial lifts; stage 1 corresponds to&#10;ordinary complex orientations, and lifting from stage (m-1) to stage m is&#10;governed by the existence of a orientation for a family of E-modules over a&#10;fixed base space F_m.&#10;  When E is p-local, we can say more. We find that this tower only changes when&#10;m is a power of p, and if E is E(n)-local the tower is constant after stage&#10;p^n. Moreover, if the coefficient ring E^* is p-torsion free, the ability to&#10;lift from stage 1 to stage p is equivalent to a condition on the associated&#10;formal group law that was shown necessary by Ando." />

We give&#10;obstruction-theoretic tools, constructing and classifying these algebras and&#10;their automorphisms with Goerss-Hopkins obstruction theory, and give&#10;descent-theoretic tools, applying Lurie's work on $\infty$-categories to show&#10;that a finite Galois extension of rings in the sense of Rognes becomes a&#10;homotopy fixed-point equivalence on Brauer spaces.&#10;  For even-periodic ring spectra $E$, we find that the &quot;algebraic&quot; Azumaya&#10;algebras whose coefficient ring is projective are governed by the Brauer-Wall&#10;group of $\pi_0(E)$, recovering a result of Baker-Richter-Szymik. This allows&#10;us to calculate many examples. For example, we find that the algebraic Azumaya&#10;algebras over Lubin-Tate spectra have either 4 or 2 Morita equivalence classes&#10;depending on whether the prime is odd or even, that all algebraic Azumaya&#10;algebras over the complex K-theory spectrum $KU$ are Morita trivial, and that&#10;the group of the Morita classes of algebraic Azumaya algebras over the&#10;localization $KU[1/2]$ is $\Bbb Z/8 \times \Bbb Z/2$.&#10;  Using our descent results and an obstruction theory spectral sequence, we&#10;also study Azumaya algebras over the real K-theory spectrum $KO$ which become&#10;Morita-trivial $KU$-algebras. We show that there exist exactly two Morita&#10;equivalence classes of these. The nontrivial Morita equivalence class is&#10;realized by an &quot;exotic&quot; $KO$-algebra with the same coefficient ring as&#10;$End_{KO}(KU)$.

          <attvalue for="1" value="Given a semisimple complex linear algebraic group $G$ and a lower ideal $I$&#10;in positive roots of $G$, three objects arise: the ideal arrangement&#10;$\mathcal{A}_I$, the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}(N,I)$,&#10;and the regular semisimple Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}(S,I)$. We show that&#10;a certain graded ring derived from the logarithmic derivation module of&#10;$\mathcal{A}_I$ is isomorphic to $H^*(\mbox{Hess}(N,I))$ and&#10;$H^*(\mbox{Hess}(S,I))^W$, the invariants in $H^*(\mbox{Hess}(S,I))$ under an&#10;action of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$. This isomorphism is shown for general Lie&#10;type, and generalizes Borel's celebrated theorem showing that the coinvariant&#10;algebra of $W$ is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of the flag variety $G/B$.&#10;  This surprising connection between Hessenberg varieties and hyperplane&#10;arrangements enables us to produce a number of interesting consequences. For&#10;instance, the surjectivity of the restriction map $H^*(G/B)\to&#10;H^*(\mbox{Hess}(N,I))$ announced by Dale Peterson and an affirmative answer to&#10;a conjecture of Sommers-Tymoczko are immediate consequences. We also give an&#10;explicit ring presentation of $H^*(\mbox{Hess}(N,I))$ in types $B$, $C$, and&#10;$G$. Such a presentation was already known in type $A$ or when&#10;$\mbox{Hess}(N,I)$ is the Peterson variety. Moreover, we find the volume&#10;polynomial of $\mbox{Hess}(N,I)$ and see that the hard Lefschetz property and&#10;the Hodge-Riemann relations hold for $\mbox{Hess}(N,I)$, despite the fact that&#10;it is a singular variety in general." />

The stable ${\mathbb Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy class&#10;of $h(F)$ is the primary obstruction to desuspending $F$ up to homotopy. The&#10;explicit nature of the construction allows for a $\pi$-equivariant version of&#10;$h(F)$ in the case of a $\pi$-equivariant $F$, with $\pi$ a discrete group. In&#10;earlier joint work we applied the $\pi_1(N)$-equivariant geometric Hopf&#10;invariant of the Umkehr map $F:\Sigma^{\infty}N^+ \to \Sigma^{\infty}T(\nu_f)$&#10;of an immersion $f:M \to N$ to capture the double points of $f$ in ${\mathbb&#10;Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory. In this manuscript we use the&#10;$\pi$-equivariant geometric Hopf invariant $h(F)$ to unify all the previous&#10;homotopy theoretic treatments of double points. Furthermore, $h(F)$ is combined&#10;with the second author's algebraic surgery theory of chain complexes with&#10;Poincar\'e duality to provide the homotopy theoretic foundations for&#10;non-simply-connected geometric surgery. For an $n$-dimensional normal map&#10;$(f,b):M \to X$ the $\pi_1(X)$-equivariant geometric Hopf invariant $h(F)$ of&#10;the Umkehr map $F:\Sigma^{\infty}X^+ \to\Sigma^{\infty}M^+$ is shown to induce&#10;the $\pi_1(X)$-equivariant quadratic structure $\psi_F$ on the chain complex&#10;kernel $C$ of $(f,b)$.

Motivated by the surprising fact that Bousfield localization can destroy&#10;some of the norm maps, in previous work we studied equivariant commutative ring&#10;structures parametrized by $N_\infty$ operads.

Incomplete Tambara&#10;functors arise as $\pi_0$ of $N_\infty$ algebras, and interpolate between Green&#10;functors and Tambara functors. We classify all incomplete Tambara functors in&#10;terms of a basic structural result about polynomial functors.

The connectivity is compactly&#10;described by the persistence diagram. One limitation of the current framework&#10;is the reliance on metric distances, whereas in many practical applications&#10;objects are compared by non-metric dissimilarity measures. Examples are the&#10;Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is commonly used for comparing text and&#10;images, and the Itakura-Saito divergence, popular for speech and sound. These&#10;are two members of the broad family of dissimilarities called Bregman&#10;divergences.&#10;  We show that the framework of topological data analysis can be extended to&#10;general Bregman divergences, widening the scope of possible applications. In&#10;particular, we prove that appropriately generalized Cech and Delaunay (alpha)&#10;complexes capture the correct homotopy type, namely that of the corresponding&#10;union of Bregman balls. Consequently, their filtrations give the correct&#10;persistence diagram, namely the one generated by the uniformly growing Bregman&#10;balls. Moreover, we show that unlike the metric setting, the filtration of&#10;Vietoris-Rips complexes may fail to approximate the persistence diagram. We&#10;propose algorithms to compute the thus generalized Cech, Vietoris-Rips and&#10;Delaunay complexes and experimentally test their efficiency.

Based on insights gained&#10;from the experiments, we propose an efficient new algorithm, called SimBa, for&#10;approximating the persistent homology of Rips filtrations with quality&#10;guarantees. Our new algorithm leverages a batch collapse strategy as well as a&#10;new sparse Rips-like filtration. We experiment on a variety of low and high&#10;dimensional data sets.

In particular, we recover a recent result of&#10;Richter-Shipley about a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between commutative&#10;$H\mathbb{Q}$-algebra spectra and commutative differential graded&#10;$\mathbb{Q}$-algebras, but our version involves only three Quillen equivalences&#10;instead of six. We also work out the theory of how to lift Quillen equivalences&#10;to categories of colored operad algebras after a left Bousfield localization." />

While rarely mentioned, this fundamental&#10;assumption inherently limits the types of neural structure and function that&#10;graphs can be used to model. Here, we describe a generalization of graphs that&#10;overcomes these limitations, thereby offering a broad range of new&#10;possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena.&#10;Specifically, we explore the use of \emph{simplicial complexes}, a theoretical&#10;notion developed in the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, which&#10;is now becoming applicable to real data due to a rapidly growing computational&#10;toolset.

In the case when&#10;$L$ is a knot, the endomorphism algebra of a distinguished object of $&#10;\tilde{\mathscr A} $ coincides with the fully noncommutative knot DGA as&#10;defined by Ekholm, Etnyre, Ng and Sullivan in [EENS13a]. The input of our&#10;construction is a natural action of the braid group $B_n$ on the category of&#10;perverse sheaves on a two-dimensional disk with singularities at $n$ marked&#10;points, studied by Gelfand, MacPherson and Vilonen in [GMV96]. As an&#10;application, we show that the category of finite-dimensional representations of&#10;the link $k$-category $ \tilde{A} = H_0(\tilde{\mathscr A}) $ defined as the&#10;$0$th homology of our DG category $ \tilde{\mathscr A} $ is equivalent to the&#10;category of perverse sheaves on $ {\mathbb R}^3 $ which are singular along the&#10;link $ L $. We also obtain several generalizations of the category $&#10;\tilde{\mathscr A} $ by extending the Gelfand-MacPherson-Vilonen braid action." />

His formula relates the cohomology of complex varieties to&#10;point counts on associated varieties over finite fields. Church, Ellenberg, and&#10;Farb use their representation stability results on the cohomology of flag&#10;manifolds, together with classical results on the cohomology rings, to prove&#10;asymptotic stability for &quot;polynomial&quot; statistics on associated varieties over&#10;finite fields. In this paper we investigate the underlying algebraic structure&#10;of these families' cohomology rings that makes the formulas convergent. We&#10;prove that asymptotic stability holds in general for subquotients of&#10;FI$_\mathcal{W}$-algebras finitely generated in degree at most one, a result&#10;that is in a sense sharp. As a consequence, we obtain convergence results for&#10;polynomial statistics on the set of maximal tori in&#10;$\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\overline{F_q})$ and $\mathrm{SO}_{2n+1}(\overline{F_q})$&#10;that are invariant under the Frobenius morphism.

In the course of the proof we establish some additional&#10;results: we give a new characterization of the integral homology of the complex&#10;of injective words, and we give a new proof of integral representation&#10;stability for configuration spaces of noncompact manifolds, extending previous&#10;results to nonorientable manifolds.
