http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06618v1@"Operad bimodules, and composition products on Andre-Quillen filtrations
  of algebras"@Luis A. Pereira@"If O is a reduced operad in symmetric spectra, an O-algebra I can be viewed
as analogous to the augmentation ideal of an augmented algebra. Implicit in the
literature on Topological Andre-Quillen homology is that such an I admits a
canonical (and homotopically meaningful) decreasing O-algebra filtration I >
I^2 > I^3 > ... satisfying various nice properties analogous to powers of an
ideal in a ring.
  In this paper, we are explicit about these constructions. With R a
commutative S-algebra, we study derived versions of the circle product M o_O I,
where M is an O-bimodule, and I is an O-algebra in R-modules. Letting M run
through a decreasing O-bimodule filtration of O itself then yields the
augmentation ideal filtration as above. The composition structure of the operad
induces algebra maps from (I^i)^j to I^{ij}, fitting nicely with previously
studied structure.
  As a formal consequence, an O-algebra map from I to J^d induces compatible
maps from I^n to J^{dn}, for all n. This is an essential tool in the first
author's study of Hurewicz maps for infinite loop spaces, and its utility is
illustrated here with a lifting theorem."@2016

http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00047v2@Strictly commutative complex orientation theory@Michael J. Hopkins@"For a multiplicative cohomology theory E, complex orientations are in
bijective correspondence with multiplicative natural transformations to E from
complex bordism cohomology MU. If E is represented by a spectrum with a highly
structured multiplication, we give an iterative process for lifting an
orientation MU -> E to a map respecting this extra structure, based on work of
Arone-Lesh. The space of strictly commutative orientations is the limit of an
inverse tower of spaces parametrizing partial lifts; stage 1 corresponds to
ordinary complex orientations, and lifting from stage (m-1) to stage m is
governed by the existence of a orientation for a family of E-modules over a
fixed base space F_m.
  When E is p-local, we can say more. We find that this tower only changes when
m is a power of p, and if E is E(n)-local the tower is constant after stage
p^n. Moreover, if the coefficient ring E^* is p-torsion free, the ability to
lift from stage 1 to stage p is equivalent to a condition on the associated
formal group law that was shown necessary by Ando."@2016

which can occur as the degrees of nonzero Stiefel-Whitney classes of vector
bundles over the Stiefel manifold $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$. In the case when $n>
k(k+4)/4$, we show that if $w_{2^q}(\xi)$ is the first nonzero Stiefel-Whitney
class of a vector bundle $\xi$ over $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ then $w_t(\xi)$ is zero
if $t$ is not a multiple of $2^q.$ In addition, we give relations among
Stiefel-Whitney classes whose degrees are multiples of $2^q$."@2016

$C_{pq}$-orbits. We deduce that in all the cases the Bredon cohomology groups
are a function of the fixed point dimensions of the underlying virtual
representations. Further, when thought of as a Mackey functor, the same
independence result holds in almost all cases. This generalizes earlier
computations of Stong and Lewis for the group $C_p$.
  The computations of cohomology of orbits are used to prove a freeness
theorem. The analogous result for the group $C_p$ was proved by Lewis. We
demonstrate that certain complex projective spaces and complex Grassmannians
satisfy the freeness theorem."@2016

functor on a wedge $X \vee Y$ of spaces (using the Hilton-Milnor theorem) and
on the cofibre $\mathrm{cof}(f)$ of a map $f: X \rightarrow Y$. We deduce some
consequences for $v_n$-periodic homotopy groups: whereas the Goodwillie tower
is finite and converges in periodic homotopy when evaluated on spheres

wedges and Moore spaces."@2016

capacity and depth of compact surfaces. We show that the capacity and depth of

quite wide family of operads in the category of complexes of vector spaces over
a field of characteristic zero. Our construction is an adaptation of Sullivan's
original step by step construction to the setting of operad algebras. The
family of operads that we consider includes all operads concentrated in degree
0 as well as their minimal models. In particular, this gives Sullivan minimal
models for algebras over Com, Ass and Lie, as well as over their minimal
models. Other interesting operads, such as the operad Ger encoding Gerstenhaber
algebras, also fit in our study."@2016
