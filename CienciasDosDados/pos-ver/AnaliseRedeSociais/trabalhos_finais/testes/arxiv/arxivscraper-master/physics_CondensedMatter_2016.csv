0809.4288@reorientation kinetics of superparamagnetic nanostructured rods@['fresnais', 'berret', 'frka-petesic', 'sandre', 'perzynski']@the attractive interactions between oppositely charged species (colloids, macromolecules etc) dispersed in water are strong, and the direct mixing of solutions containing such species generally yields to a precipitation, or to a phase separation. we have recently developed means to control the electrostatically-driven attractions between nanoparticles and polymers in water, and at the same time to preserve the stability of the dispersions. we give here an account of the formation of supracolloidal aggregates obtained by co-assembly of 7 nm particles with copolymers. nanostructured rods of length comprised between 5 and 50 microns and diameter 500 nm were investigated. by application of a magnetic field, the rods were found to reorient along with the magnetic field lines. the kinetics of reorientation was investigated using step changes of the magnetic field of amplitude 90 degrees. from the various results obtained, among which an exponential decay of the tangent of the angle made between the rod and the field, we concluded that the rods are superparamagnetic.
0907.3979@electrostatic co-assembly of magnetic nanoparticles and fluorescent   nanospheres: a versatile approach toward bimodal nanorods@['fresnais', 'ishow', 'sandre', 'berret']@the elaboration of multimodal nanoparticles stimulates tremendous interest owing to their numerous potentialities in many applicative fields like optoelectronics, photonics and especially bioimaging. the concomitant association of various properties (optical, electrochemical, magnetic) allows for the use of complementary stimuli in order to probe the interactions between the nanoparticles and their surroundings.nanoparticles (nps) have thus become highly praised tools to image cells and tissues with a large contrast compatible with the dimensions of biological materials and the existence of quantum confinement effects induced by the reduced dimensions. in this context, the combination of magnetism and emissive properties such as fluorescence appears particularly attractive for non-invasive investigations, cell sorting or drug vectorization. therefore, combining both fluorescence and magnetism requires the delicate construction of hybrid assemblies. most of the magnetic nanoparticles are made of metallic oxides or alloys, e.g. gamma-fe2o3, fe3o4, fept, while the target fluorescent entities are often organic dyes or quantum dots (qds).
1006.1855@electron energy spectrum of the spin-liquid state in a frustrated   hubbard model@['antipov', 'rubtsov', 'katsnelson', 'lichtenstein']@non-local correlation effects in the half-filled hubbard model on an isotropic triangular lattice are studied within a spin polarized extension of the dual fermion approach. a competition between the antiferromagnetic non-collinear and the spin liquid states is strongly enhanced by an incorporation of a k-dependent self-energy beyond the local dynamical mean-field theory. the dual fermion correc- tions drastically decrease the energy of a spin liquid state while leaving the non-collinear magnetic states almost non-affected. this makes the spin liquid to become a preferable state in a certain interval of interaction strength of an order of the magnitude of a bandwidth. the spectral function of the spin-liquid mott insulator is determined by a formation of local singlets which results in the energy gap of about twice larger than that of the 120 degrees antiferromagnetic neel state.
1009.5751@fractality of hofstadter butterfly in specific heat oscillation@['yang', 'xu', 'qin', 'xiang']@we calculate thermodynamical properties of the hofstadter model using a recently developed quantum transfer matrix method. we find intrinsic oscillation features in specific heat that manifest the fractal structure of the hofstadter butterfly. we also propose experimental approaches which use specific heat as an access to detect the hofstadter butterfly.
1311.6022@universal scaling law to predict the efficiency of magnetic   nanoparticles as mri t2-contrast agents@['vuong', 'berret', 'fresnais', 'gossuin', 'sandre']@magnetic particles are very efficient magnetic resonance imaging (mri) contrast agents. in the recent years, chemists have unleashed their imagination to design multi-functional nanoprobes for biomedical applications including mri contrast enhancement. this study is focused on the direct relationship between the size and magnetization of the particles and their nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation properties, which condition their efficiency. experimental relaxation results with maghemite particles exhibiting a wide range of sizes and magnetizations are compared to previously published data and to well-established relaxation theories with a good agreement. this allows deriving the experimental master curve of the transverse relaxivity versus particle size and to predict the mri contrast efficiency of any type of magnetic nanoparticles. this prediction only requires the knowledge of the size of the particles impermeable to water protons and the saturation magnetization of the corresponding volume. to predict the t2 relaxation efficiency of magnetic single crystals, the crystal size and magnetization obtained through a single langevin fit of a magnetization curve is the only information needed. for contrast agents made of several magnetic cores assembled into various geometries (dilute fractal aggregates, dense spherical clusters, core-shell micelles, hollow vesicles), one needs to know a third parameter, namely the intra-aggregate volume fraction occupied by the magnetic materials relatively to the whole (hydrodynamic) sphere. finally a calculation of the maximum achievable relaxation effect and the size needed to reach this maximum is performed for different cases: maghemite single crystals and dense clusters, core-shell particles (oxide layer around a metallic core) and zinc manganese ferrite crystals.
1403.0953@wire deconstructionism of two-dimensional topological phases@['neupert', 'chamon', 'mudry', 'thomale']@a scheme is proposed to construct integer and fractional topological quantum states of fermions in two spatial dimensions. we devise models for such states by coupling wires of non-chiral luttinger liquids of electrons, that are arranged in a periodic array. which inter-wire couplings are allowed is dictated by symmetry and the compatibility criterion that they can simultaneously acquire a finite expectation value, opening a spectral gap between the ground state(s) and all excited states in the bulk. first, with these criteria at hand, we reproduce the tenfold classification table of integer topological insulators, where their stability against interactions becomes immediately transparent in the luttinger liquid description. second, we construct an example of a strongly interacting fermionic topological phase of matter with short-range entanglement that lies outside of the tenfold classification. third, we expand the table to long-range entangled topological phases with intrinsic topological order and fractional excitations.
1404.3519@fulde-ferrell-larkin-ovchinnikov states in a superconducting ring with   magnetic fields: phase diagram and the first-order phase transitions@['yoshii', 'takada', 'tsuchiya', 'marmorini', 'hayakawa', 'nitta']@we find the angular fulde-ferrell-larkin-ovchinnikov (fflo) states (or the twisted kink crystals) in which a phase and an amplitude of a pair potential modulate simultaneously in a quasi-onedimensional superconducting ring with a static zeeman magnetic field applied on the ring and static aharonov-bohm magnetic flux penetrating the ring. the superconducting ring with magnetic flux produces a persistent current, whereas the zeeman split of fermi energy results in the spatial modulation of the pair potential. we show that these two magnetic fields stabilize the fflo phase in a large parameter region of the magnetic fields. we further draw the phase diagram with the two kinds of first-order phase transitions; one corresponds to phase slips separating the aharonov-bohm magnetic flux, and the other separates the number of peaks of the pair amplitude for the zeeman magnetic field.
1404.6697@quantum monte carlo studies of spinons in one-dimensional spin systems@['tang', 'sandvik']@observing constituent particles with fractional quantum numbers in confined and deconfined states is an interesting and challenging problem in quantum many-body physics. here we further explore a computational scheme [y. tang and a. w. sandvik, phys. rev. lett. {\bf 107}, 157201 (2011)] based on valence-bond quantum monte carlo simulations of quantum spin systems. using several different one-dimensional models, we characterize $s=1/2$ spinon excitations using the spinon size and confinement length (the size of a bound state). the spinons have finite size in valence-bond-solid states, infinite size in the critical region, and become ill-defined in the n\'eel state. we also verify that pairs of spinons are deconfined in these uniform spin chains but become confined upon introducing a pattern of alternating coupling strengths (dimerization) or coupling two chains (forming a ladder). in the dimerized system an individual spinon can be small when the confinement length is large---this is the case when the imposed dimerization is weak but the ground state of the corresponding uniform chain is a spontaneously formed valence-bond-solid (where the spinons are deconfined). based on our numerical results, we argue that the situation $\lambda \ll \lambda$ is associated with weak repulsive short-range spinon-spinon interactions. in principle both the length-scales can be individually tuned from small to infinite (with $\lambda \le \lambda$) by varying model parameters. in the ladder system the two lengths are always similar, and this is the case also in the dimerized systems when the corresponding uniform chain is in the critical phase. in these systems the effective spinon-spinon interactions are purely attractive and there is only a single large length scale close to criticality, which is reflected in the standard spin correlations as well as in the spinon characteristics.
1408.3608@on the nature of heat in strongly coupled open quantum systems@['esposito', 'ochoa', 'galperin']@we study heat transfers in a single level quantum dot strongly coupled to fermionic reservoirs and subjected to a time-dependent protocol modulating the dot energy as well as the dot-reservoir coupling strength. the dynamics is described using nonequilibrium greens functions (negfs) evaluated to first order beyond quasi-static driving. we show that any heat definition expressed as an energy change in the reservoir energy plus any fraction of the system-reservoir interaction is not an exact differential when evaluated along reversible isothermal transformations, except when that fraction is zero. however, even in that latter case the reversible heat divided by temperature, namely the entropy, does not satisfy the third law of thermodynamics and diverges in the low temperature limit. our results cast doubts on the possibility to define a thermodynamically consistent notion of heat expressed as the expectation value of some hamiltonian terms.
1408.3662@separated spin-up and spin-down evolution of degenerated electrons in   two dimensional systems: dispersion of longitudinal collective excitations in   plane and nanotube geometry@"['andreev', ""kuz'menkov""]"@applying the separated spin evolution quantum hydrodynamics to two-dimensional electron gas in plane samples and nanotubes located in external magnetic fields we find new kind of wave in electron gas, which is called the spin-electron acoustic wave. separate spin-up electrons and spin-down electrons evolution reveals in replacement of the langmuir wave by the couple of hybrid waves. one of two hybrid waves is the modified langmuir wave. another hybrid wave is the spin-electron acoustic wave. we study dispersion of these waves in two dimensional structures of electrons. we also consider dependence of dispersion properties on spin polarisation of electrons in external magnetic field.
1409.0620@switching of perpendicularly polarized nanomagnets with spin orbit   torque without an external magnetic field by engineering a tilted anisotropy@['you', 'lee', 'bhowmik', 'labanowski', 'hong', 'bokor', 'salahuddin']@spin orbit torque (sot) provides an efficient way of generating spin current that promises to significantly reduce the current required for switching nanomagnets. however, an in-plane current generated sot cannot deterministically switch a perpendicularly polarized magnet due to symmetry reasons. on the other hand, perpendicularly polarized magnets are preferred over in-plane magnets for high-density data storage applications due to their significantly larger thermal stability in ultra-scaled dimensions. here we show that it is possible switch a perpendicularly polarized magnet by sot without needing an external magnetic field. this is accomplished by engineering an anisotropy in the magnets such that the magnetic easy axis slightly tilts away from the film-normal. such a tilted anisotropy breaks the symmetry of the problem and makes it possible to switch the magnet deterministically. using a simple ta/cofeb/mgo/ta heterostructure, we demonstrate reversible switching of the magnetization by reversing the polarity of the applied current. this demonstration presents a new approach for controlling nanomagnets with spin orbit torque.
1410.2704@chiral electromagnetic waves in weyl semimetal@['zyuzin', 'zyuzin']@we show that weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry can host chiral electromag- netic waves. the magnetization that results in a momentum space separation of a pair of opposite chirality weyl nodes is also responsible for the non-zero gyrotropy parameter in the system. it is then shown that a chiral electromagnetic wave can propagate in a region of space where the gyrotropy parameter changes sign. such waves are analogs of quantum hall edge states for photons.
1411.4415@exploring the phase diagram of the two-impurity kondo problem@['spinelli', 'gerrits', 'toskovic', 'bryant', 'ternes', 'otte']@a system of two exchange-coupled kondo impurities in a magnetic field gives rise to a rich phase space hosting a multitude of correlated phenomena. magnetic atoms on surfaces probed through scanning tunnelling microscopy provide an excellent platform to investigate coupled impurities, but typical high kondo temperatures prevent field-dependent studies from being performed, rendering large parts of the phase space inaccessible. we present an integral study of pairs of co atoms on insulating cu2n/cu(100), which each have a kondo temperature of only 2.6 k. in order to cover the different regions of the phase space, the pairs are designed to have interaction strengths similar to the kondo temperature. by applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field, we are able to access a new phase in which the two coupled impurities are simultaneously screened. comparison of differential conductance spectra taken on the atoms to simulated curves, calculated using a third order transport model, allows us to independently determine the degree of kondo screening in each phase.
1502.06570@spin fluctuations in iron pnictides and chalcogenides: from   antiferromagnetism to superconductivity@['inosov']@the present article reviews recent experimental investigations of spin dynamics in iron-based superconductors and their parent compounds by means of inelastic neutron scattering. it mainly focuses on the most contemporary developments in this field, pertaining to the observations of magnetic resonant modes in new superconductors, spin anisotropy of low-energy magnetic fluctuations that has now been observed in a wide range of chemical compositions and doping levels, as well as their momentum-space anisotropy incurred by the spin-nematic order. the implications of these new findings for our understanding of the superconducting state, along with the remaining unsettled challenges for neutron spectroscopy, are discussed.
1502.07960@dynamical decoupling based quantum sensing: floquet spectroscopy@['lang', 'liu', 'monteiro']@"sensing the internal dynamics of individual nuclear spins or clusters of nuclear spins has recently become possible by observing the coherence decay of a nearby electronic spin: the weak magnetic noise is amplified by a periodic, multi-pulse decoupling sequence. however, it remains challenging to robustly infer underlying atomic-scale structure from decoherence traces in all but the simplest cases. we introduce floquet spectroscopy as a versatile paradigm for analysis of these experiments, and argue it offers a number of general advantages. in particular, this technique generalises to more complex situations, offering physical insight in regimes of many-body dynamics, strong coupling and pulses of finite duration. as there is no requirement for resonant driving, the proposed spectroscopic approach permits physical interpretation of striking, but overlooked, coherence decay features in terms of the form of the avoided crossings of the underlying quasienergy eigenspectrum. this is exemplified by a set of ""diamond"" shaped features arising for transverse-field scans in the case of single-spin sensing by nv-centers in diamond. we investigate also applications for donors in silicon showing that the resulting tunable interaction strengths offer highly promising future sensors."
1503.06006@parallel stability analysis of membrane lamellar structures and foam   films@['ivanova', 'tsekov']@in the frames of the dlvo theory the root mean square amplitude of capillary waves in a thin liquid film is calculated and its dependence on some important physical parameters is unveiled. two important models are considered: films with classical interfaces and films between lipid bilayers. the performed numerical analysis demonstrates essential difference in their behavior due to the different elastic properties of the film surfaces. it is shown that the film lifetime is significantly long at some magic film radii.
1503.08302@persistent currents with non-quantized angular momentum@['mateo', 'gallemí', 'guilleumas', 'mayol']@we analyze the generation of persistent currents in bose-einstein condensates of ultracold gases confined in a ring. this phenomenon has been recently investigated in an experiment [nature \textbf{506}, 200 (2014)], where hysteresis loops have been observed in the activation of quantized persistent currents by rotating weak links. in this work, we demonstrate the existence of 3d stationary currents with non-quantized angular momentum. they are generated by families of solitary waves that show a continuous variation in the angular momentum, and provide a bridge between different winding numbers. we show that the size of hysteresis loops is determined by the range of existence within the weak link region of solitary waves which configure the energy barrier preventing phase slips. the barrier vanishes when the critical rotation leads winding numbers and solitonic states to a matching configuration. at this point, landau and feynman criteria for phase slips meet: the fluid flow reaches the local speed of sound, and stationary vortex lines (which are the building blocks of solitons) can be excited inside the system.
1504.03806@frustration and correlations in stacked triangular lattice ising   antiferromagnets@['burnell', 'chalker']@we study multilayer triangular lattice ising antiferromagnets with interlayer interactions that are weak and frustrated in an abc stacking. by analysing a coupled height model description of these systems, we show that they exhibit a classical spin liquid regime at low temperature, in which both intralayer and interlayer correlations are strong but there is no long range order. diffuse scattering in this regime is concentrated on a helix in reciprocal space, as observed for charge-ordering in the materials lufe$_2$o$_4$ and ybfe$_2$o$_4$.
1504.05882@controlled complete suppression of single-atom inelastic spin and   orbital cotunnelling@['bryant', 'toskovic', 'ferrón', 'lado', 'spinelli', 'fernández-rossier', 'otte']@the inelastic portion of the tunnel current through an individual magnetic atom grants unique access to read out and change the atom's spin state, but it also provides a path for spontaneous relaxation and decoherence. controlled closure of the inelastic channel would allow for the latter to be switched off at will, paving the way to coherent spin manipulation in single atoms. here we demonstrate complete closure of the inelastic channels for both spin and orbital transitions due to a controlled geometric modification of the atom's environment, using scanning tunnelling microscopy (stm). the observed suppression of the excitation signal, which occurs for co atoms assembled into chain on a cu$_2$n substrate, indicates a structural transition affecting the d$_z$$^2$ orbital, effectively cutting off the stm tip from the spin-flip cotunnelling path.
1505.00445@driving magnetic skyrmions with microwave fields@['wang', 'beg', 'zhang', 'kuch', 'fangohr']@we show theoretically by numerically solving the landau-lifshitz-gilbert equation with a classical spin model on a two-dimensional system that both magnetic skyrmions and skyrmion lattices can be moved with microwave magnetic fields. the mechanism is enabled by breaking the axial symmetry of the skyrmion, for example through application of a static in-plane external field. the net velocity of the skyrmion depends on the frequency and amplitude of the microwave fields as well as the strength of the in-plane field. the maximum velocity is found where the frequency of the microwave coincides with the resonance frequency of the breathing mode of the skyrmions.
1505.00728@resonant magneto-optic kerr effect in the magnetic topological insulator   cr:(sb$_x$,bi$_{1-x}$)$_2$te$_3$@['patankar', 'hinton', 'griesmar', 'orenstein', 'dodge', 'kou', 'pan', 'wang', 'bestwick', 'fox', 'goldhaber-gordon', 'wang', 'zhang']@we report measurements of the polar kerr effect, proportional to the out-of-plane component of the magnetization, in thin films of the magnetically doped topological insulator $(\text{cr}_{0.12}\text{bi}_{0.26}\text{sb}_{0.62})_2\text{te}_3$. measurements of the complex kerr angle, $\theta_k$, were performed as a function of photon energy in the range $0.8\text{ ev}<\hbar\omega<3.0\text{ ev}$. we observed a peak in the real part of $\theta_k(\omega)$ and zero crossing in the imaginary part that we attribute to resonant interaction with a spin-orbit avoided crossing located $\approx$ 1.6 ev above the fermi energy. the resonant enhancement allows measurement of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of $\theta_k$ in the ultrathin film limit, $d\geq2$ quintuple layers. we find a sharp transition to zero remanent magnetization at 6 k for $d<8$~ql, consistent with theories of the dependence of impurity spin interactions on film thickness and their location relative to topological insulator surfaces.
1505.05987@fluctuating hydrodynamics approach to equilibrium time correlations for   anharmonic chains@['spohn']@linear fluctuating hydrodynamics is a useful and versatile tool for describing fluids, as well as other systems with conserved fields, on a mesoscopic scale. in one spatial dimension, however, transport is anomalous, which requires to develop a nonlinear extension of fluctuating hydrodynamics. the relevant nonlinearity turns out to be the quadratic part of the euler currents when expanding relative to a uniform background. we outline the theory and compare with recent molecular dynamics simulations.
1505.07686@graphene schottky diodes: an experimental review of the rectifying   graphene/semiconductor heterojunction@['di bartolomeo']@in the past decade graphene has been one of the most studied material for several unique and excellent properties. due to its two dimensional nature, physical and chemical properties and ease of manipulation, graphene offers the possibility of integration with the exiting semiconductor technology for next-generation electronic and sensing devices. in this context, the understanding of the graphene/semiconductor interface is of great importance since it can constitute a versatile standalone device as well as the building-block of more advanced electronic systems. since graphene was brought to the attention of the scientific community in 2004, the device research has been focused on the more complex graphene transistors, while the graphene/semiconductor junction, despite its importance, has started to be the subject of systematic investigation only recently. as a result, a thorough understanding of the physics and the potentialities of this device is still missing. the studies of the past few years have demonstrated that graphene can form junctions with 3d or 2d semiconducting materials which have rectifying characteristics and behave as excellent schottky diodes. the main novelty of these devices is the tunable schottky barrier height, a feature which makes the graphene/semiconductor junction a great platform for the study of interface transport mechanisms as well as for applications in photo-detection, high-speed communications, solar cells, chemical and biological sensing, etc. in this paper, we review the state-of-the art of the research on graphene/semiconductor junctions, the attempts towards a modeling and the most promising applications.
1506.01444@quantum spirals@['yoshida', 'mahajan']@quantum systems often exhibit fundamental incapability to entertain vortex. the meissner effect, a complete expulsion of the magnetic field (the electromagnetic vorticity), for instance, is taken to be the defining attribute of the superconducting state. superfluidity is another, close-parallel example; fluid vorticity can reside only on topological defects with a limited (quantized) amount. recent developments in the bose-einstein condensates produced by particle traps further emphasize this characteristic. we show that the challenge of imparting vorticity to a quantum fluid can be met through a nonlinear mechanism operating in a hot fluid corresponding to a thermally modified pauli-schroedinger spinor field. in a simple field-free model, we show that the thermal effect, represented by a nonlinear, non-hermitian hamiltonian, in conjunction with spin vorticity, leads to new interesting quantum states; a spiral solution is explicitly worked out.
1506.05006@on integrable directed polymer models on the square lattice@['thiery', 'doussal']@in a recent work povolotsky provided a three-parameter family of stochastic particle systems with zero-range interactions in one dimension which are integrable by coordinate bethe ansatz. using these results we obtain the corresponding condition for integrability of a class of directed polymer models with random weights on the square lattice. analyzing the solutions we find, besides known cases, a new two-parameter family of integrable dp model, which we call the inverse-beta polymer, and provide its bethe ansatz solution.
1506.05089@rare events, the thermodynamic action and the continuous-time limit@['malsom', 'pinski']@we consider diffusion-like paths that are explored by a particle moving via a conservative force while being in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. to probe rare transitions, we use the onsager-machlup (om) functional as a path probability distribution function for double-ended paths that are constrained to start and stop at predesignated points after a fixed time. we explore the continuous-time limit where the om functional has been commonly regularized by using the ito-girsanov change of measure. when used as a path measure, the ito-girsanov expression generates an ensemble of double-ended paths that are unphysical. we expose the underlying reasons why this continuous-time limit does not, and cannot, generate a thermodynamic ensemble of paths. furthermore, we show that the concept of the most probable path and the thermodynamic action are incompatible with such measures for discrete or continuous time diffusion processes.
1506.06168@direct measure of giant magnetocaloric entropy contributions in ni-mn-in@['chen', 'bruno', 'karaman', 'huang', 'li', 'ross']@off-stoichiometric alloys based on ni 2 mnin have drawn attention due to the coupled first order magnetic and structural transformations, and the large magnetocaloric entropy associated with the transformations. here we describe calorimetric and magnetic studies of four compositions. the results provide a direct measure of entropy changes contributions including at the first-order phase transitions, and thereby a determination of the maximum field-induced entropy change corresponding to the giant magnetocaloric effect. we find a large excess entropy change, attributed to magneto-elastic coupling, but only in compositions with no ferromagnetic order in the high-temperature austenite phase. furthermore, a molecular field model corresponding to antiferromagnetism of the low-temperature phases is in good agreement, and nearly independent of composition, despite significant differences in overall magnetic response of these materials.
1506.06500@fast, label-free tracking of single viruses and weakly scattering   nanoparticles in a nano-fluidic optical fiber@['faez', 'lahini', 'weidlich', 'garmann', 'wondraczek', 'zeisberger', 'schmidt', 'orrit', 'manoharan']@high-speed tracking of single particles is a gateway to understanding physical, chemical, and biological processes at the nanoscale. it is also a major experimental challenge, particularly for small, nanometer-scale particles. although methods such as confocal or fluorescence microscopy offer both high spatial resolution and high signal-to-background ratios, the fluorescence emission lifetime limits the measurement speed, while photobleaching and thermal diffusion limit the duration of measurements. here we present a tracking method based on elastic light scattering that enables long-duration measurements of nanoparticle dynamics at rates of thousands of frames per second. we contain the particles within a single-mode silica fiber containing a sub-wavelength, nano-fluidic channel and illuminate them using the fiber's strongly confined optical mode. the diffusing particles in this cylinderical geometry are continuously illuminated inside the collection focal plane. we show that the method can track unlabeled dielectric particles as small as 20 nm as well as individual cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (ccmv) virions - 4.6 megadaltons in size - at rates of over 2 khz for durations of tens of seconds. our setup is easily incorporated into common optical microscopes and extends their detection range to nanometer-scale particles and macromolecules. the ease-of-use and performance of this technique support its potential for widespread applications in medical diagnostics and micro total analysis systems.
1506.07030@photon berry phases, instantons, schrodinger cats with oscillating   parities and crossover from $ u(1) $ to $ z_2 $ limit in cavity qed systems@['yi-xiang', 'ye', 'liu', 'zhang']@in this work, we study the $ u(1)/z_2 $ dicke model at a finite $ n $ by using the $ 1/j $ expansion and exact diagonization. this model includes the four standard quantum optics model as its various special limits. the $ 1/j $ expansions is complementary to the strong coupling expansion used by the authors in arxiv:1512.08581 to study the same model in its dual $ z_2/u(1) $ representation. we identify 3 regimes of the system's energy levels: the normal, $ u(1) $ and quantum tunneling (qt) regime. the system's energy levels are grouped into doublets which consist of scattering states and schrodinger cats with even ( e ) and odd ( o ) parities in the $ u(1) $ and quantum tunneling (qt) regime respectively. in the qt regime, by the wkb method, we find the emergencies of bound states one by one as the interaction strength increases, then investigate a new class of quantum tunneling processes through the instantons between the two bound states in the compact photon phase. it is the berry phase interference effects in the instanton tunneling event which leads to schrodinger cats oscillating with even and odd parities in both ground and higher energy bound states. we map out the energy level evolution from the $ u(1) $ to the qt regime and also discuss some duality relations between the energy levels in the two regimes. we also compute the photon correlation functions, squeezing spectrum, number correlation functions in both regimes which can be measured by various experimental techniques. the combinations of the results achieved here by $ 1/j $ expansion and those in arxiv:1512.08581 by strong coupling method lead to rather complete understandings of the $ u(1)/z_2 $ dicke model at a finite $ n $ and any anisotropy parameter $ \beta $.
1506.07692@localization of weakly interacting bose gas in quasiperiodic potential@['ray', 'pandey', 'ghosh', 'sinha']@we study the localization properties of weakly interacting bose gas in a quasiperiodic potential commonly known as aubry-andr\'e model. effect of interaction on localization is investigated by computing the `superfluid fraction' and `inverse participation ratio'. for interacting bosons the inverse participation ratio increases very slowly after the localization transition due to `multisite localization' of the wave function. we also study the localization in aubry-andr\'e model using an alternative approach of classical dynamical map, where the localization is manifested by chaotic classical dynamics. for weakly interacting bose gas, bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum and condensate fraction are calculated in order to study the loss of coherence with increasing disorder strength. finally we discuss the effect of trapping potential on localization of matter wave.
1507.00337@three-dimensional topological photonic crystal with a single surface   dirac cone@['lu', 'fang', 'fu', 'johnson', 'joannopoulos', 'soljačić']@"a single dirac cone on the surface is the hallmark of three-dimensional (3d) topological insulators, where the double degeneracy at the dirac point is protected by time-reversal symmetry and the spin-splitting away from the point is provided by the spin-orbital coupling. here we predict a single dirac-cone surface state in a 3d photonic crystal, where the degeneracy at the dirac point is protected by a nonsymmorphic glide reflection and the linear splitting away from it is enabled by breaking time-reversal symmetry. such a gapless surface state is fully robust against random disorder of any type. this bosonic topological band structure is achieved by applying alternating magnetization to gap out the 3d ""generalized dirac points"" discovered in the bulk of our crystal. the $z_2$ bulk invariant is characterized through the evolution of wannier centers. our proposal--readily realizable using ferrimagnetic materials at microwave frequencies--can also be regarded as the photonic analog of topological crystalline insulators, providing the first 3d bosonic symmetry-protected topological system."

1507.04179@the physicist's companion to current fluctuations: one-dimensional   bulk-driven lattice gases@['lazarescu']@one of the main features of statistical systems out of equilibrium is the currents they exhibit in their stationary state: microscopic currents of probability between configurations, which translate into macroscopic currents of mass, charge, etc. understanding the general behaviour of these currents is an important step towards building a universal framework for non-equilibrium steady states akin to the gibbs-boltzmann distribution for equilibrium systems. in this review, we consider one-dimensional bulk-driven particle gases, and in particular the asymmetric simple exclusion process (asep) with open boundaries, which is one of the most popular models of one-dimensional transport. we focus, in particular, on the current of particles flowing through the system in its steady state, and on its fluctuations. we show how one can obtain the complete statistics of that current, through its large deviation function, by combining results from various methods: exact calculation of the cumulants of the current, using the integrability of the model ; direct diagonalisation of a biased process in the limits of very high or low current ; hydrodynamic description of the model in the continuous limit using the macroscopic fluctuation theory (mft). we give a pedagogical account of these techniques, starting with a quick introduction to the necessary mathematical tools, as well as a short overview of the existing works relating to the asep. we conclude by drawing the complete dynamical phase diagram of the current. we also remark on a few possible generalisations of these results.
1508.00071@theory of primary photoexcitations in donor-acceptor copolymers@['aryanpour', 'dutta', 'huynh', 'vardeny', 'mazumdar']@we present a generic theory of primary photoexcitations in low band gap donor-acceptor conjugated copolymers. because of the combined effects of strong electron correlations and broken symmetry, there is considerable mixing between a charge-transfer exciton and an energetically proximate triplet-triplet state with an overall spin singlet. the triplet-triplet state, optically forbidden in homopolymers, is allowed in donor-acceptor copolymers. for an intermediate difference in electron affinities of the donor and the acceptor, the triplet-triplet state can have stronger oscillator strength than the charge-transfer exciton. we discuss the possibility of intramolecular singlet fission from the triplet-triplet state, and how such fission can be detected experimentally.
1509.00132@magnon instability driven by heat current in magnetic bilayers@['ohnuma', 'adachi', 'saitoh', 'maekawa']@we theoretically demonstrate that, in a ferromagnet/paramagnet bilayer, a magnon instability accompanied by a gigahertz microwave emission can be driven simply by means of a temperature bias. employing many-body theory for investigating the effects of a phonon heat current on the magnon lifetime, we show that the magnon instability occurs upon the suppression of the umklapp scattering at low temperatures, leading to microwave emission. the present finding provides crucial information about the interplay of spin current and heat current.

1509.05450@imaging electric fields in the vicinity of cryogenic surfaces using   rydberg atoms@['thiele', 'deiglmayr', 'stammeier', 'agner', 'schmutz', 'merkt', 'wallraff']@the ability to characterize static and time-dependent electric fields in situ is an important prerequisite for quantum-optics experiments with atoms close to surfaces. especially in experiments which aim at coupling rydberg atoms to the near field of superconducting circuits, the identification and subsequent elimination of sources of stray fields is crucial. we present a technique that allows the determination of stray-electric-field distributions $(f^\text{str}_\text{x}(\vec{r}),f^\text{str}_\text{y}(\vec{r}),f^\text{str}_\text{z}(\vec{r}))$ at distances of less than $2~\text{mm}$ from (cryogenic) surfaces using coherent rydberg-stark spectroscopy in a pulsed supersonic beam of metastable $1\text{s}^12\text{s}^1~{}^{1}s_{0}$ helium atoms. we demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by characterizing the electric stray field emanating from a structured superconducting surface. exploiting coherent population transfer with microwave radiation from a coplanar waveguide, the same technique allows the characterization of the microwave-field distribution above the surface.
1509.06769@chiral separation and chiral magnetic effects in a slab: the role of   boundaries@['gorbar', 'miransky', 'shovkovy', 'sukhachov']@we study the chiral separation and chiral magnetic effects in a slab of dirac semimetal of finite thickness, placed in a constant magnetic field perpendicular to its surfaces. we utilize the bogolyubov boundary conditions with a large dirac mass (band gap) outside the slab. we find that, in a finite thickness slab, the axial current density is induced by helicity-correlated standing waves and, as a consequence, is quantized. the quantization is seen in its stepped-shape dependence on the fermion chemical potential and a sawtooth-shape dependence on the thickness of the slab. in contrast to a naive expectation, there is no chiral charge accumulation anywhere in the bulk or at the boundaries of the semimetal. in the same slab geometry, we also find that a nonzero chiral chemical potential induces no electric current, as might have been expected from the chiral magnetic effect. we argue that this outcome is natural and points to the truly non-static nature of the latter. by taking into account a nonzero electric field of a double layer near the boundaries of the slab, we find that the low-energy modes under consideration satisfy the continuity equation for axial current density without the anomalous term.

1509.08283@polaronic effects in one- and two-band quantum systems@['yin', 'cocks', 'hofstetter']@"in this work we study the formation and dynamics of polarons in a system with a few impurities in a lattice immersed in a bose-einstein condensate (bec). this system has been experimentally realized using ultracold atoms and optical lattices. here we consider a two-band model for the impurity atoms, along with a bogoliubov approximation for the bec, with phonons coupled to impurities via both intra- and inter-band transitions. we decouple this fr\""ohlich-like term by an extended two-band lang-firsov polaron transformation using a variational method. the new effective hamiltonian with two (polaron) bands differs from the original hamiltonian by modified coherent transport, polaron energy shifts and induced long-range interaction. a lindblad master equation approach is used to take into account residual incoherent coupling between polaron and bath. this polaronic treatment yields a renormalized inter-band relaxation rate compared to fermi's golden rule. for a strongly coupled two-band fr\""ohlich hamiltonian, the polaron is tightly dressed in each band and can not tunnel between them, leading to an inter-band self-trapping effect."

1510.01465@stability and dispersion relations of three-dimensional solitary waves   in trapped bose-einstein condensates@['mateo', 'brand']@we analyse the dynamical properties of three-dimensional solitary waves in cylindrically trapped bose-einstein condensates. families of solitary waves bifurcate from the planar dark soliton and include the solitonic vortex, the vortex ring and more complex structures of intersecting vortex-line known collectively as chladni solitons. the particle-like dynamics of these guided solitary waves provides potentially profitable features for their implementation in atomtronic circuits, and play a key role in the generation of metastable loop currents. based on the time-dependent gross-pitaevskii equation we calculate the dispersion relations of moving solitary waves and their modes of dynamical instability. the dispersion relations reveal a complex crossing and bifurcation scenario. for stationary structures we find that for $\mu/\hbar\omega_\perp > 2.65$ the solitonic vortex is the only stable solitary wave. more complex chladni solitons still have weaker instabilities than planar dark solitons and may be seen as transient structures in experiments. fully time-dependent simulations illustrate typical decay scenarios, which may result in the generation of multiple separated solitonic vortices.
1510.01976@landau-zener interference at bichromatic driving@['forster', 'mühlbacher', 'blattmann', 'schuh', 'wegscheider', 'ludwig', 'kohler']@we investigate experimentally and theoretically the interference at avoided crossings which are repeatedly traversed as a consequence of an applied ac field. our model system is a charge qubit in a serial double quantum dot connected to two leads. our focus lies on effects caused by simultaneous driving with two different frequencies. we work out how the commensurability of the driving frequencies affects the symmetry of the interference patterns both in real space and in fourier space. for commensurable frequencies, the symmetry depends sensitively on the relative phase between the two modes, whereas for incommensurable frequencies the symmetry of monochromatic driving is always recovered.
1510.02026@an efficient matrix product operator representation of the   quantum-chemical hamiltonian@['keller', 'dolfi', 'troyer', 'reiher']@we describe how to efficiently construct the quantum chemical hamiltonian operator in matrix product form. we present its implementation as a density matrix renormalization group (dmrg) algorithm for quantum chemical applications in a purely matrix product based framework. existing implementations of dmrg for quantum chemistry are based on the traditional formulation of the method, which was developed from a viewpoint of hilbert space decimation and attained a higher performance compared to straightforward implementations of matrix product based dmrg. the latter variationally optimizes a class of ansatz states known as matrix product states (mps), where operators are correspondingly represented as matrix product operators (mpo). the mpo construction scheme presented here eliminates the previous performance disadvantages while retaining the additional flexibility provided by a matrix product approach; for example, the specification of expectation values becomes an input parameter. in this way, mpos for different symmetries - abelian and non-abelian - and different relativistic and non-relativistic models may be solved by an otherwise unmodified program.
1510.02357@spin excitations in a model of fese with orbital ordering@['kreisel', 'mukherjee', 'hirschfeld', 'andersen']@"we present a theoretical study of the dynamical spin susceptibility for the intriguing fe-based superconductor fese, based on a tight-binding model developed to account for the temperature-dependent band structure in this system. the model allows for orbital ordering in the $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ channel below the structural transition and presents a strongly $c_4$ symmetry broken fermi surface at low temperatures which accounts for the nematic properties of this material. the calculated spin excitations are peaked at wave vector $(\pi,0)$ in the 1-fe brillouin zone, with a broad maximum at energies of order a few mev. in this range, the occurrence of superconductivity sharpens this peak in energy, creating a $(\pi,0)$ ""neutron resonance"" as seen in recent experiments. with the exception of the quite low energy scale of these fluctuations, these results are roughly similar to standard behavior in fe pnictide systems. at higher energies, however, intensity increases and shifts to wave vectors along the $(\pi,0)$ - $(\pi,\pi)$ line. we compare with existing inelastic neutron experiments and nmr data, and give predictions for further studies."

1511.00149@proposal for ultrafast switching of ferroelectrics using mid-infrared   pulses@['subedi']@i propose a method for ultrafast switching of ferroelectric polarization using mid-infrared pulses. this involves selectively exciting the highest frequency $a_1$ phonon mode of a ferroelectric material with an intense mid-infrared pulse. large amplitude oscillations of this mode provides a unidirectional force to the lattice such that it displaces along the lowest frequency $a_1$ phonon mode coordinate because of a nonlinear coupling of the type $g q_{\textrm{p}} q_{\textrm{ir}}^2$ between the two modes. first principles calculations show that this coupling is large in transition-metal oxide ferroelectrics, and the sign of the coupling is such that the lattice displaces in the switching direction. furthermore, i find that the lowest frequency $a_1$ mode has a large $q_{\textrm{p}}^3$ order anharmonicity, which causes a discontinuous switch of electric polarization as the pump amplitude is continuously increased.
1511.03165@exact diagonalization study of bose-condensed gas with finite-range   gaussian interaction@['imran', 'ahsan']@we investigate a system of $n$ spinless bosons confined in quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap with repulsive two-body finite-range gaussian interaction potential of large $s$-wave scattering length. exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix is carried out to obtain the $n$-body ground state as well as low-lying excited states, using davidson algorithm in beyond lowest-landau-level approximation. we examine the finite-range effects of the interaction potential on the many-body ground state energy as also the degree of condensation of the bose-condensed gas. the results obtained indicate that the finite-range gaussian interaction potential enhances the degree of condensation compared to the zero-range interaction potential. we further analyze the effect of finite-range interaction potential on the breathing mode collective excitation. our theoretical results may be relevant for experiments currently conducted on quasi-two-dimensional bose gas with more realistic interaction potential.
1511.04236@two-dimensional time-reversible ergodic maps with provisions for   dissipation@['patra']@a new discrete time-reversible map of a unit square onto itself is proposed. the map comprises of piecewise linear two-dimensional operations, and is able to represent the macroscopic features of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamical systems. our operations are analogous to sinusoidally driven shear in the two dimensions, and a radial compression/expansion of a point lying outside/inside a circle centered around origin. depending upon the radius, the map transitions from being ergodic and nondissipative (like in equilibrium situations) to a limit cycle through intermediate multifractal situations (like in nonequilibrium situations). all dissipative cases of the proposed map suggest that the kaplan -- yorke dimension is smaller than the embedding dimension, a feature typically arising in nonequilibrium steady-states. the proposed map differs from the existing maps like the baker's map and arnold's cat map in the sense that (i) it is reversible, and (ii) it generates an intricate multifractal phase-space portrait.
1511.05106@surface reconstructions and transport of epitaxial ptlusb (001) thin   films grown by mbe@['patel', 'logan', 'harrington', 'schultz', 'palmstrøm']@this work presents the surface reconstructions and transport properties of the topological insulator ptlusb grown on al0.1in0.9sb/gaas (001). two stable surface reconstructions, (1x3) and c(2x2), were observed on ptlusb (001) surfaces. antimony-dimerization was determined to be the nature of the (1x3) surface reconstruction as evidenced by chemical binding energy shifts in the antimony 4d core-level for surface bonding components. the two surface reconstructions were studied as a function of sb4 overpressure and substrate temperature to create a reconstruction phase diagram. from this reconstruction phase diagram, a growth window from 320 {\deg}c to 380 {\deg}c using an antimony overpressure was identified. within this window, the highest quality films were grown at a growth temperature of 380 {\deg}c. these films exhibited lower p-type carrier concentrations as well as relatively high hole mobilities.

1511.06926@pressure and high tc superconductivity: applications to sulfur hydrides@"[""gor'kov"", 'kresin']"@the rapid variation of the superconductivity tc in hydride sulfur (h3s) under high pressure [a. drozdov et al, nature 525, 73 (2015); m. einaga et al, arxiv: 1509.03156] in a vicinity pcr=123gpa is interpreted in terms of the 1st order transition, possibly related to a cdw-instability with a non-zero structural vector. the superconductivity mechanisms in high-tc phase be discussed, ordinary methods of calculating tc are shown not applicable in h3s because, beside the acoustic branches, its phonon spectrum contains hydrogen modes with much higher frequency. a modified approach provides realistic tc values. the isotope effect (change of tc at the substitution of deuterium for hydrogen) owes its origin to the high frequency of phonons and is different in different phases. the decrease of tc after reaching a maximum in high-t phase is due to the interaction with the second gap arising on a hole-like pocket. the phonon-mediated pairing on the latter is in a non-adiabatic regime of the frequency omega of hydrogen modes comparable to the fermi energy.
1512.02855@microcanonical entropy: consistency and adiabatic invariance@['tavassoli', 'montakhab']@attempts to establish microcanonical entropy as an adiabatic invariant date back to works of gibbs and hertz. more recently, a consistency relation based on adiabatic invariance has been used to argue for the validity of gibbs (volume) entropy over boltzmann (surface) entropy. such consistency relation equates derivatives of thermodynamic entropy to ensemble average of the corresponding quantity in micro-state space (phase space or hilbert space). in this work we propose to re-examine such a consistency relation when the number of particles ($n$) is considered as the independent thermodynamic variable. in other words, we investigate the consistency relation for the chemical potential which is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity. we show both by simple analytical calculations as well as model example that neither definitions of entropy satisfy the consistency condition when one considers such a relation for the chemical potential. this remains true regardless of the system size. therefore, our results cast doubt on the validity of the adiabatic invariance as a required property of thermodynamic entropy. we close by providing commentary on the derivation of thermostatistics from mechanics which typically leads to controversial and inconsistent results.

1512.04429@chimera states in coupled kuramoto oscillators with inertia@['olmi']@the dynamics of two symmetrically coupled populations of rotators is studied for different values of the inertia. the system is characterized by different types of solutions, which all coexist with the fully synchronized state. at small inertia the system is no more chaotic and one observes mainly quasi- periodic chimeras, while the usual (stationary) chimera state is not anymore observable. at large inertia one observes two different kind of chaotic solutions with broken symmetry: the intermittent chaotic chimera, characterized by a synchronized population and a population displaying a turbulent behaviour, and a second state where the two populations are both chaotic but whose dynamics adhere to two different macroscopic attractors. the intermittent chaotic chimeras are characterized by a finite life-time, whose duration increases as a power-law with the system size and the inertia value. moreover, the chaotic population exhibits clear intermittent behavior, displaying a laminar phase where the two populations tend to synchronize, and a turbulent phase where the macroscopic motion of one population is definitely erratic. in the thermodynamic limit these states survive for infinite time and the laminar regimes tends to disappear, thus giving rise to stationary chaotic solutions with broken symmetry contrary to what observed for chaotic chimeras on a ring geometry.
1512.04911@manipulating p-and s-elastic waves in dielectric elastomers via external   electric stimuli@['galich', 'rudykh']@we investigate elastic wave propagation in finitely deformed dielectric elastomers in the presence of an electrostatic field. to analyze the propagation of both longitudinal (p-) and transverse (s-) waves, we utilize compressible material models. we derive explicit expressions of the generalized acoustic tensor and phase velocities of elastic waves for the ideal and enriched dielectric elastomer models. we analyze the slowness curves of the elastic wave propagation, and find the p-s-mode disentangling phenomenon. in particular, p- and s- waves are separated by the application of an electric field. the divergence angle between p- and s-waves strongly depends on the applied electrostatic excitation. the influence of the electric field is sensitive to material models. thus, for ideal dielectric model the in-plane shear velocity increases with an increase in electric field, while for the enriched model the velocity may decreases depending on material constants. similarly, the divergence angle gradually increases with an increase in electric field, while for the enriched model, the angle may be bounded. material compressibility affects the p-wave velocity, and, for relatively compressible materials, the slowness curves evolve from circular to elliptical shapes manifesting in an increase of the reflection angle of p-waves. as a results, the divergence angle decreases with an increase in material compressibility.
1512.07111@imaging nanophotonic modes of microresonators using a focused ion beam@['twedt', 'zou', 'davanco', 'srinivasan', 'mcclelland', 'aksyuk']@optical microresonators have proven powerful in a wide range of applications, including cavity quantum electrodynamics, biosensing, microfludics, and cavity optomechanics. their performance depends critically on the exact distribution of optical energy, confined and shaped by the nanoscale device geometry. near-field optical probes can image this distribution, but the physical probe necessarily perturbs the near field, which is particularly problematic for sensitive high quality factor resonances. we present a new approach to mapping nanophotonic modes that uses a controllably small and local optomechanical perturbation introduced by a focused lithium ion beam. an ion beam (radius about 50 nm) induces a picometer-scale dynamic deformation of the resonator surface, which we detect through a shift in the optical resonance wavelength. we map five modes of a silicon microdisk resonator (q > 20,000) with both high spatial and spectral resolution. our technique also enables in-situ observation of ion implantation damage and relaxation dynamics in a silicon lattice.
1512.08333@exponential system-size dependence of the lifetime of transient spiral   chaos in excitable and oscillatory media@['sugimura', 'kori']@excitable media can develop spiral chaos, in which the number of spirals changes chaotically with time. depending on parameter values in dynamical equations, spiral chaos may permanently persist or spontaneously arrive at a steady state after a transient time, referred to as the lifetime. previous numerical studies have demonstrated that the lifetime of transient spiral chaos increases exponentially with system size to a good approximation. in this study, using the fact that the number of spirals obeys a gaussian distribution, we provide a general expression for the system size dependence of the lifetime for large system sizes, which is indeed exponential. we confirm that the expression is in good agreement with numerically obtained lifetimes for both excitable and oscillatory media with parameter sets near the onset of transient chaos. the expression we develop for the lifetime is expected to be useful for predicting lifetimes in large systems.

1601.00216@negative differential electrical resistance of a rotational organic   nanomotor@['sadeghi', 'sangtarash', 'al-galiby', 'sparks', 'bailey', 'lambert']@a robust nanoelectromechanical switch is proposed based upon an asymmetric pendant moiety anchored to an organic backbone between two c60 fullerenes, which in turn are connected to gold electrodes. ab initio density functional calculations are used to demonstrate that an electric field induces rotation of the pendant group, leading to a non-linear current-voltage relation. the non-linearity is strong enough to lead to negative differential resistance at modest source-drain voltages.
1601.00217@conductance enlargement in pico-scale electro-burnt graphene   nanojunctions@['sadeghi', 'mol', 'lau', 'briggs', 'warner', 'lambert']@provided the electrical properties of electro-burnt graphene junctions can be understood and controlled, they have the potential to underpin the development of a wide range of future sub-10nm electrical devices. we examine both theoretically and experimentally the electrical conductance of electro-burnt graphene junctions at the last stages of nanogap formation. we account for the appearance of a counterintuitive increase in electrical conductance just before the gap forms. this is a manifestation of room-temperature quantum interference and arises from a combination of the semi-metallic band structure of graphene and a crossover from electrodes with multiple-path connectivity to single-path connectivity just prior to breaking. therefore our results suggest that conductance enlargement prior to junction rupture is a signal of the formation of electro-burnt junctions, with a pico-scale current path formed from a single sp2-bond.
1601.00220@sensing single molecules with carbon-boron-nitride nanotubes@['algharagholy', 'pope', 'al-galiby', 'sadeghi', 'bailey', 'lambert']@we investigate the molecular sensing properties of carbon nanotube-boron nitride-carbon nanotube (cnt-bn-cnt) junctions. we demonstrate that the electrical conductance of such a junction changes in response to the binding of an analyte molecule to the region of bn. the change in conductance depends on the length of the bn spacer and the position of the analyte and therefore we propose a method of statistically analysing conductance data. we demonstrate the ability to discriminate between analytes, by computing the conductance changes due to three analytes (benzene, thiol-capped oligoyne and a pyridyl-capped oligoyne) binding to junctions with five different lengths of bn spacer.
1601.00222@gating of single molecule junction conductance by charge transfer   complex formation@['vezzoli', 'grace', 'brooke', 'wang', 'lambert', 'xu', 'nichols', 'higgins']@the solid-state structures of organic charge transfer (ct) salts are critical in determining their mode of charge transport, and hence their unusual electrical properties, which range from semiconducting through metallic to superconducting. in contrast, using both theory and experiment, we show here that the conductance of metal | single molecule | metal junctions involving aromatic donor moieties (dialkylterthiophene, dialkylbenzene) increase by over an order of magnitude upon formation of charge transfer (ct) complexes with tetracyanoethylene (tcne). this enhancement occurs because ct complex formation creates a new resonance in the transmission function, close to the metal contact fermi energy, that is a signal of room-temperature quantum interference.
1601.00224@basic concepts in single-molecule electronics@['lambert']@this tutorial outlines the basic theoretical concepts and tools which underpin the fundamentals of phase-coherent electron transport through single molecules. the key quantity of interest is the transmission coefficient t(e), which yields the electrical conductance, current-voltage relations, the thermopower s and the thermoelectric figure of merit zt of single-molecule devices. since t(e) is strongly affected by quantum interference (qi), three manifestations of qi in single-molecules are discussed, namely mach-zehnder interferometry, breit-wigner resonances and fano resonances. a simple matlab code is provided, which allows the novice reader to explore qi in multi-branched structures described by a tight-binding (huckel) hamiltonian. more generally, the strengths and limitations of materials-specific transport modelling based on density functional theory are discussed.
1601.00253@a concentric plasmonic platform for the efficient excitation of surface   plasmon-polaritons@['rahbany', 'geng', 'salas-montiel', 'de la cruz', 'méndez', 'blaize', 'bachelot', 'couteau']@we propose a plasmonic device consisting of a concentric ring grating acting as an efficient tool for directional launching and detection of surface plasmon-polaritons (spps). numerical simulations and optical characterizations are used to study the fabricated structured gold surface. we demonstrate that this circularly symmetrical plasmonic device provides an efficient interface between free space radiation and spps. this structure offers an excellent platform for the study of hybrid plasmonics in general and of plasmon-emitter couplings in particular, such as those occurring when exciting dye molecules placed inside the ring. as illustrated in this work, an interesting property of the device is that the position of excitation determines the direction of propagation of the spps, providing a flexible mean of studying their interactions with molecules or dipole-like emitters placed on the surface.
1601.00353@black hole thermodynamics in finite time@['gruber']@"finite-time thermodynamics provides the means to revisit ideal thermodynamic equilibrium processes in the light of reality and investigate the energetic ""price of haste"", i.e. the consequences of carrying out a process in finite time, when perfect equilibrium cannot be awaited due to economic reasons or the nature of the process. employing the formalism of geometric thermodynamics, a lower bound on the energy dissipated during a process is derived from the thermodynamic length of that process. the notion of length is hereby defined via a metric structure on the space of equilibrium thermodynamics, spanned by a set of thermodynamic variables describing the system. since the aim of finite-time thermodynamics is to obtain realistic limitations on idealized scenarios, it is a useful tool to reassess the efficiency of thermodynamic processes. we examine its implications for black hole thermodynamics, in particular scenarios inspired by the penrose process, a thought experiment by which work can be extracted from a rotating black hole. we consider a kerr black hole which, by some mechanism, is losing mass and angular momentum. thermodynamically speaking, such a process is described in the equilibrium phase space of the black hole, but in reality, it is neither reversible nor infinitely slow. we thus calculate the dissipated energy due to non-ideal finite-time effects."
1601.00365@superhigh moduli and tension-induced phase transition of monolayer   gamma-boron at finite temperatures@['zhao', 'yang', 'wei', 'kou']@two dimensional (2d) gamma-boron ({\gamma}-b28) thin films have been firstly reported by the experiments of the chemical vapor deposition in the latest study [tai et al., angew. chem. int. ed. 54, 1-6 (2015)]. however, their mechanical properties are still not clear. here we predict the superhigh moduli (1460 gpa at 1 k and 744 gpa at 300 k) and the tension-induced phase transition of monolayer {\gamma}-b28 along a zigzag direction for large deformations at finite temperatures using molecular dynamics (md) simulations. the new phase can be kept stable after unloading process at these temperatures. the predicted mechanical properties are reasonable with our results from density functional theory. this study provides physical insights into the origins of the new phase transition of monolayer {\gamma}-b28 at finite temperatures.
1601.00422@a near field optical image of a gold surface: a luminescence study@['merlen', 'plathier', 'ruediger']@this paper addresses recent experimental findings about luminescence of a gold tip in near-field interaction with a gold surface. our electrochemically etched gold tips show a typical, intrinsic luminescence that we exploit to track the plasmon resonance modeled by a lorentzian oscillator. our experimental device is based on a spectrometer optically coupled to an atomic force microscope used in tuning fork mode. our measurements provide evidence of a strong optical coupling between the tip and the surface. we demonstrate that this coupling strongly affects the luminescence (intensity, wavelength and fhwm) as a function of the tip position in 2d maps. the fluctuation of these parameters is directly related to the plasmonic properties of the gold surface and is used to qualify the optical near field enhancement (which subsequently plays the predominant role in surface enhanced spectroscopies) with a very high spatial resolution (typically around 20 nm). we compare these findings to the independently recorded near-field scattered elastic rayleigh signal.
1601.00423@optical vortex driven charge current loop and optomagnetism in   fullerenes@['wätzel', 'pavlyukh', 'schäffer', 'berakdar']@endohedral molecular magnets, e.g. as realized in fullerenes containing $\rm dysc_{2}n$, are promising candidates for molecular electronics and quantum information processing. for their functionalization an ultrafast local magnetization control is essential. using full ab-initio quantum chemistry calculations we predict the emergence of charge current loops in fullerenes with an associated orbital magnetic moment upon irradiation with weak light vortex pulses that transfer orbital angular momentum. the generated current is controllable by the frequency, the vortex topological charge, and the intensity of the light. numerical and analytical results show that an ultraviolet vortex femtosecond pulse with an intensity $\sim10^{13}$ w/cm$^2$ generates non-invasively na unidirectional surface current with an associated magnetic field of hundreds $\mu$t at the center of the fullerene.
1601.00429@making consistent contacts to graphene: effect of architecture and   growth induced defects@['b', 'pratap', 'raghavan']@the effect of contact architecture, graphene defect density and metal-semiconductor work function difference on resistivity of metal-graphene contacts have been investigated. an architecture with metal on the bottom of graphene is found to yield resistivities that are lower, by a factor of 4, and most consistent as compared to metal on top of graphene. growth defects in graphene film were found to further reduce resistivity by a factor of 2. using a combination of method and metal used, the contact resistivity of graphene has been decreased by a factor of 10 to 1200 +- 250 ohm-um using palladium as the contact metal. while the improved consistency is due to the metal being able to contact uncontaminanted graphene in the metal on the bottom architecture, lower contact resistivities observed on defective graphene with the same metal is attributed to the increased number of modes of quantum transport in the channel.
1601.00444@unidirectional terahertz light absorption in the pyroelectric   ferrimagnet cabaco4o7@['bordács', 'kocsis', 'tokunaga', 'nagel', 'rõõm', 'takahashi', 'taguchi', 'tokura']@spin excitations were studied by absorption spectroscopy in cabaco4o7 which is a type-i multiferroic compound with the largest magnetic-order induced ferroelectric polarization ({\delta}p=17mc/m2) reported, so far. we observed two optical magnon branches: a solely electric dipole allowed one and a mixed magnetoelectric resonance. the entangled magnetization and polarization dynamics of the magnetoelectric resonance gives rise to unidirectional light absorption, i.e. that magnon mode absorbs the electromagnetic radiation for one propagation direction but not for the opposite direction. our systematic study of the magnetic field and temperature dependence of magnon modes provides information about the energies and symmetries of spin excitations, which is required to develop a microscopic spin model of cabaco4o7.
1601.00478@thermodynamics of amyloid formation and the role of intersheet   interactions@['irbäck', 'wessén']@the self-assembly of proteins into $\beta$-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils has been observed to occur with sigmoidal kinetics, indicating that the system initially is trapped in a metastable state. here, we use a minimal lattice-based model to explore the thermodynamic forces driving amyloid formation in a finite canonical ($nvt$) system. by means of generalized-ensemble monte carlo techniques and a semi-analytical method, the thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated for different sets of intersheet interaction parameters. when the interactions support lateral growth into multi-layered fibrillar structures, an evaporation/condensation transition is observed, between a supersaturated solution state and a thermodynamically distinct state where small and large fibril-like species exist in equilibrium. intermediate-size aggregates are statistically suppressed. these properties do not hold if aggregate growth is one-dimensional.
1601.00489@structures with vertically stacked ge/si quantum dots for logical   operations@"['morokov', 'fedoruk', 'dvurechenskii', ""zinov'eva"", 'nenashev']"@ge/si structures with vertically stacked quantum dots are simulated to implement the basic elements of a quantum computer for operation with electron spin states. elastic-strain fields are simulated using the conjugate gradient method and an atomistic model based on the keating potential. calculations are performed in the cluster approximation using clusters containing about three million atoms belonging to 150 coordination spheres. the spatial distributions of the strain energy density and electron potential energy are calculated for different valleys forming the bottom of the silicon conduction band. it is shown that the development of multilayer structures with vertically stacked quantum dots makes it possible to fabricate deep potential wells for electrons with vertical tunnel coupling.

1601.00515@reentrant disorder-disorder transitions in generalized multicomponent   widom-rowlinson models@['krčmár', 'šamaj']@"in the lattice version of the multicomponent widom-rowlinson (wr) model, each site can be either empty or singly occupied by one of $m$ different particles, all species having the same fugacity $z$. the only nonzero interaction potential is a nearest-neighbor hard-core exclusion between unlike particles. for $m<m_0$ with some minimum $m_0$ dependent on the lattice structure, as $z$ increases from 0 to $\infty$ there is a direct transition from the disordered (gas) phase to a demixed (liquid) phase with one majority component at $z>z_d(m)$. if $m\ge m_0$, there is an intermediate ordered ""crystal phase"" (composed of two nonequivalent even and odd sublattices) for $z$ lying between $z_c(m)$ and $z_d(m)$ which is driven by entropy. we generalize the multicomponent wr model by replacing the hard-core exclusion between unlike particles by more realistic large (but finite) repulsion. the model is solved exactly on the bethe lattice with an arbitrary coordination number. the numerical calculations, based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group, are performed for the two-dimensional square lattice. the results for $m=4$ indicate that the second-order phase transitions from the disordered gas to the demixed phase become of first order, for an arbitrarily large finite repulsion. the results for $m\ge m_0$ show that, as the repulsion weakens, the region of crystal phase diminishes itself. for weak enough repulsions, the direct transition between the crystal and demixed phases changes into a separate pair of crystal-gas and gas-demixed transitions; this is an example of a disorder-disorder reentrant transition via an ordered crystal phase. if the repulsion between unlike species is too weak, the crystal phase disappears from the phase diagram. it is shown that the generalized wr model belongs to the ising universality class."
1601.00536@energy shift and conduction-to-valence band transition mediated by a   time dependent potential barrier in graphene@['chaves', 'da costa', 'de sousa', 'pereira', 'farias']@we investigate the scattering of a wave packet describing low-energy electrons in graphene by a time-dependent finite step potential barrier. our results demonstrate that, after klein tunneling through the barrier, the electron acquires an extra energy which depends on the rate of change the barrier height in time. if such a rate is negative, the electron loses energy and ends up as a valence band state after leaving the barrier, which effectively behaves as a positively charged quasi-particle
1601.00541@cross-linking inhomogeneity in nano-composite hydrogels can be observed   as sharp peaks by saxs experiments under elongation@['nishi', 'shibayama']@we introduced silica nanoparticles into poly ($n$,$n$-dimethylacrylamide) gel, (pdam-nc gel), and poly (acrylamide) gel (pam-nc gel), and carried out saxs measurements under uniaxial elongation. it is well known that pdam chains are strongly adsorbed onto silica nanoparticles while pam chains are not. interestingly, we found from saxs measurements that scattering profiles depend on the polymer-nanoparticle interaction. a four-spot pattern was observed in the 2d structure factors of pdam-nc gel, which was assigned to a movement of the nanoparticles affinely under elongation. however, unexpectedly, we observed sharp peaks in the 2d structure factors of pam-nc gel in the parallel direction to the stretching. these peaks appeared in much lower-$q$ region than the theoretical prediction of affine deformation of nanoparticles. we conjecture that these peaks do not correspond to the correlation of individual particles but to the correlation of high cross-linking regions because the interaction between pam chains and silica nanoparticles is relatively weak and the displacements of silica nanoparticles are sensitive to spatial cross-linking inhomogeneity.
1601.00545@valley filtering using electrostatic potentials in bilayer graphene@['da costa', 'chaves', 'sena', 'farias', 'peeters']@propagation of an electron wave packet through a quantum point contact (qpc) defined by electrostatic gates in bilayer graphene is investigated. the gates provide a bias between the layers, in order to produce an energy gap. if the gates on both sides of the contact produce the same bias, steps in the electron transmission probability are observed, as in the usual qpc. however, if the bias is inverted on one of the sides of the qpc, only electrons belonging to one of the dirac valleys are allowed to pass, which provides a very efficient valley filtering.
1601.00548@the split-operator technique for the study of spinorial wavepacket   dynamics@['chaves', 'farias', 'peeters', 'ferreira']@"the split-operator technique for wave packet propagation in quantum systems is expanded here to the case of propagating wave functions describing schr\""odinger particles, namely, charge carriers in semiconductor nanostructures within the effective mass approximation, in the presence of zeeman effect, as well as of rashba and dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. we also demonstrate that simple modifications to the expanded technique allow us to calculate the time evolution of wave packets describing dirac particles, which are relevant for the study of transport properties in graphene."
1601.00575@disclinations, e-cones, and their interactions in extensible sheets@['chopin', 'kudrolli']@we investigate the nucleation, growth, and spatial organization of topological defects with a ribbon shaped elastic sheet which is stretched and twisted. singularities are found to spontaneously arrange in a triangular lattice in the form of vertices connected by stretched ridges that result in a self-rigidified structure. the vertices are shown to be negative disclinations or e-cones which occur in sheets with negative gaussian curvature, in contrast with d-cones in sheets with zero-gaussian curvature. we find the growth of the wrinkled width of the ribbon to be consistent with a far-from-threshold approach assuming a compression-free base state. the system is found to show a transition from a regime where the wavelength is given by the ribbon geometry, to where it is given by its elasticity as a function of the ratio of the applied tension to the elastic modulus and cross-sectional area of the ribbon.

1601.00619@band structure of topological insulators from noise measurements in   tunnel junctions@['cascales', 'martınez', 'katmis', 'chang', 'guerrero', 'moodera', 'aliev']@the unique properties of spin-polarized surface or edge states in topological insulators (tis) make these quantum coherent systems interesting from the point of view of both fundamental physics and their implementation in low power spintronic devices. here we present such a study in tis, through tunneling and noise spectroscopy utilizing ti/al$_2$o$_3$/co tunnel junctions with bottom ti electrodes of either bi$_2$te$_3$ or bi$_2$se$_3$. we demonstrate that features related to the band structure of the ti materials show up in the tunneling conductance and even more clearly through low frequency noise measurements. the bias dependence of 1/f noise reveals peaks at specific energies corresponding to band structure features of the ti. ti tunnel junctions could thus simplify the study of the properties of such quantum coherent systems, that can further lead to the manipulation of their spin-polarized properties for technological purposes.

physics/9911030@one-way multigrid method in electronic structure calculations@['lee', 'kim', 'martin']@we propose a simple and efficient one-way multigrid method for self-consistent electronic structure calculations based on iterative diagonalization. total energy calculations are performed on several different levels of grids starting from the coarsest grid, with wave functions transferred to each finer level. the only changes compared to a single grid calculation are interpolation and orthonormalization steps outside the original total energy calculation and required only for transferring between grids. this feature results in a minimal amount of code change, and enables us to employ a sophisticated interpolation method and noninteger ratio of grid spacings. calculations employing a preconditioned conjugate gradient method are presented for two examples, a quantum dot and a charged molecular system. use of three grid levels with grid spacings 2h, 1.5h, and h decreases the computer time by about a factor of 5 compared to single level calculations.
