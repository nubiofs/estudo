http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04748v2@Betti numbers of unordered configuration spaces of the torus@['Christoph Schiessl']@"Using a method of F\'elix and Thomas we compute the Betti numbers of
unordered configuration spaces of the torus."@2016
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04897v2@Homological stability for configuration spaces of orbifolds@['Jeffrey Bailes', 'TriThang Tran']@"We prove that homological stability holds for configuration spaces of
orbifolds. This builds on the work of Bailes' thesis where he proves that the
stabilisation maps are injective."@2016
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04943v1@Twisted Novikov homology of complex hypersurface complements@['Stefan Friedl', 'Laurentiu Maxim']@"We study the twisted Novikov homology of the complement of a complex
hypersurface in general position at infinity. We give a self-contained
topological proof of the vanishing (except possibly in the middle degree) of
the twisted Novikov homology groups associated to positive cohomology classes
of degree one defined on the complement."@2016
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05295v2@Topological Symmetries of R^3@['Slawomir Kwasik', 'Fang Sun']@"If a finite group acts topologically, faithfully and orientation preservingly
on R^3, then it is isomorphic to a subgroup of SO(3)."@2016
http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05406v2@"The Betti numbers of real toric varieties associated to Weyl chambers of
  type $B$"@['Suyoung Choi', 'Boram Park', 'Hanchul Park']@"We compute the (rational) Betti number of real toric varieties associated to
Weyl chambers of type $B$. Furthermore, we show that their integral cohomology
is $p$-torsion free for all odd primes $p$."@2016
