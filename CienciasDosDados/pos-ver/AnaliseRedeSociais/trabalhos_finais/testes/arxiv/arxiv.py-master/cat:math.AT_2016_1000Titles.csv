chain-connectedness in terms of $\mu$-homology is provided. We also introduce
the notion of S-homotopy, which is weaker than uniform homotopy. We prove that
$\mu$-homology theory satisfies the S-homotopy axiom, and that every uniform
space can be S-deformation retracted to a dense subset. It follows that for

  of algebras"@['Nicholas J. Kuhn', 'Luis A. Pereira']@"If O is a reduced operad in symmetric spectra, an O-algebra I can be viewed
as analogous to the augmentation ideal of an augmented algebra. Implicit in the
literature on Topological Andre-Quillen homology is that such an I admits a
canonical (and homotopically meaningful) decreasing O-algebra filtration I >
I^2 > I^3 > ... satisfying various nice properties analogous to powers of an
ideal in a ring.
  In this paper, we are explicit about these constructions. With R a
commutative S-algebra, we study derived versions of the circle product M o_O I,
where M is an O-bimodule, and I is an O-algebra in R-modules. Letting M run
through a decreasing O-bimodule filtration of O itself then yields the
augmentation ideal filtration as above. The composition structure of the operad
induces algebra maps from (I^i)^j to I^{ij}, fitting nicely with previously
studied structure.
  As a formal consequence, an O-algebra map from I to J^d induces compatible
maps from I^n to J^{dn}, for all n. This is an essential tool in the first
author's study of Hurewicz maps for infinite loop spaces, and its utility is
illustrated here with a lifting theorem."@2016

detect loop spaces and those that solve Deligne's conjecture. The former
deformation retract to Milgram's space obtained by gluing together permutahedra

well. Even more is true, the quotient is actually already an operad up to
homotopy, which induces the operad structure on cellular chains adapted to
prove Deligne's conjecture, while no such structure is known on Milgram's
space. We show, explicitely, that these two quotients are homotopy equivalent.
This gives a new topological proof that operads of this type are indeed of the
right homotopy type. It also furnishes a very nice clean description in terms
of polyhedra, and with it PL topology, for the whole story. The permutahedra

bijective correspondence with multiplicative natural transformations to E from
complex bordism cohomology MU. If E is represented by a spectrum with a highly
structured multiplication, we give an iterative process for lifting an
orientation MU -> E to a map respecting this extra structure, based on work of
Arone-Lesh. The space of strictly commutative orientations is the limit of an
inverse tower of spaces parametrizing partial lifts; stage 1 corresponds to
ordinary complex orientations, and lifting from stage (m-1) to stage m is
governed by the existence of a orientation for a family of E-modules over a
fixed base space F_m.
  When E is p-local, we can say more. We find that this tower only changes when
m is a power of p, and if E is E(n)-local the tower is constant after stage
p^n. Moreover, if the coefficient ring E^* is p-torsion free, the ability to
lift from stage 1 to stage p is equivalent to a condition on the associated

is a configuration of points with multiplicity located in the punctured complex

http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02066v2@On the symmetric squares of complex and quaternionic projective space@['Yumi Boote', 'Nigel Ray']@"The problem of computing the integral cohomology ring of the symmetric square

progress has been made on the general case until recently. In this work we
offer a solution for the complex and quaternionic projective spaces $KP^n$, by
taking advantage of their rich geometrical structure. Our description is in
terms of generators and relations, and our methods entail ideas that have
appeared in the literature of quantum chemistry, theoretical physics, and
combinatorics. We deal first with the case $KP^\infty$, and proceed by
identifying the truncation required for passage to finite n. The calculations
rely upon a ladder of long exact cohomology sequences, which arises by
comparing cofibrations associated to the diagonals of the symmetric square and
the corresponding Borel construction. The cofibrations involve classic
configuration spaces of unordered pairs of 1-dimensional subspaces of
$K^{n+1}$, and their one-point compactifications; the latter are identified as
Thom spaces by combining Lowdin's symmetric orthogonalisation process (and its
quaternionic extension) with a dash of Pin geometry. The ensuing integral
cohomology rings may be conveniently expressed using generalised Fibonacci
polynomials. By way of validation, we note that our conclusions are compatible
with mod 2 computations of Nakaoka and with homological results of Milgram."@2016

the infinite loop space structure on $BO$ implied by the Bott periodicity.
Applying a length filtration allows to state our results in the case of

be modeled first, and then the spaces and maps of the individual models be
specified in accordance with the topology. Axiomatically, this construction
leads to sheaves. Sheaf theory provides a toolbox for constructing predictive
models described by systems of equations. Sheaves are mathematical objects that
manage the combination of bits of local information into a consistent whole.
The power of this approach is that complex models can be assembled from

studying differential topology.
  Many revered texts, such as Spivak's ""Calculus on Manifolds"" and Guillemin
and Pollack's ""Differential Topology"" introduce forms by first working through
properties of alternating tensors. Unfortunately, many students get bogged down
with the whole notion of tensors and never get to the punch lines: Stokes'
Theorem, de Rham cohomology, Poincare duality, and the realization of various
topological invariants (e.g. the degree of a map) via forms, none of which
actually require tensors to make sense!
  In these notes, we'll follow a different approach, following the philosophy
of Amy's Ice Cream: Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first.
  We're first going to define forms on $\mathbb{R}^n$ via unmotivated formulas,
develop some proficiency with calculation, show that forms behave nicely under
changes of coordinates, and prove Stokes' Theorem. This approach has the
disadvantage that it doesn't develop deep intuition, but the strong advantage
that the key properties of forms emerge quickly and cleanly. Only then, in
Chapter 3, will we go back and show that tensors with certain (anti)symmetry
properties have the exact same properties as the formal objects that we studied
in Chapters 1 and 2. This allows us to re-interpret all of our old results from
a more modern perspective, and move onwards to using forms to do topology."@2016

of a virtual bundle over a certain section space. This can be viewed as a
twisted form of the non-abelian Poincar\'e duality theorem of Segal, Salvatore,

generalizes the results of Blumberg-Cohen-Schlichtkrull on the topological

with supports contained in $\partial\Omega$ whose homology classes in $\mathbb
R^3 \setminus \Omega$ form a basis of $H_1(\mathbb R^3 \setminus \Omega;\mathbb

of each one of these $1$-boundaries. The Poincar\'e--Lefschetz duality theorem
ensures that the relative homology classes of these homological Seifert
surfaces in $\overline\Omega$ modulo $\partial\Omega$ form a basis of
$H_2(\overline\Omega,\partial\Omega;\mathbb Z)$. We devise a simply procedure
for the construction of the required set of $1$-boundaries of

computed, or can find their equivalence in terms of Ext-groups. For instance,
important (co)homology theories, such as the Mac Lane cohomology for rings or
the Hochschild and cyclic homology of commutative algebras can be defined as
Ext-groups in suitable functor categories; homotopical invariants can also gain
information from homological data with the help of the unstable Adams spectral
sequence, whose input takes the form of Ext-groups in the category of unstable
modules over the Steenrod algebra. Therefore, the constructions of explicit
injective (projective) resolutions in an abelian category is of great
importance. In this article, we introduce a new method, called
Pseudo-hyperresolution, to study such constructions. This method originates in
the category of unstable modules, and aims at building explicit resolutions for
the reduced singular cohomology of spheres. In particular, for all integers
$n\geq 0$, we can describe a large range of the minimal injective resolution of
the sphere $S^{n}$ based on the Bockstein operation of the Steenrod algebra.
Moreover, many classical constructions in algebraic topology, such as the
algebraic EHP sequence or the Lambda algebra can be recovered using the
Pseudo-hyperresolution method. A particular connection between spheres and the
infinite complex projective space is also established. Despite its origin,
Pseudo-hyperresolution generalizes to all abelian categories. In particular,
many explicit resolutions of classical strict polynomial functors can be

special and interesting examples of real toric varieties. We first give a
presentation of the fundamental group of a real Bott tower and show that the
fundamental group is abelian if and only if the real Bott tower is a product of
circles. We further prove that the fundamental group of a real Bott tower is
always solvable and it is nilpotent if and only if it is abelian. We then
describe the cohomology ring of a real Bott tower and also give recursive
formulae for the Steifel Whitney classes. We derive combinatorial
characterization for orientability of these manifolds and further give a
combinatorial formula for the $(n-1)$th Steifel Whitney class. In particular,
we show that if a Bott tower is orientable then the $(n-1)$th Steifel Whitney
class must also vanish. Moreover, by deriving a combinatorial formula for the
second Steifel-Whitney class we give a necessary and sufficient condition for
the Bott tower to admit a spin structure. We finally prove the vanishing of all
the Steifel-Whitney numbers and hence establish that these manifolds are

is the stabilization analog of the Quillen-Sullivan theory main result that the
rational chains (resp. cochains) functor participates in a derived equivalence
with certain coalgebra (resp. algebra) complexes, after restriction to
1-connected spaces up to rational equivalence. In more detail, we prove that
the stabilization of spaces functor participates in a derived equivalence with
certain coalgebra spectra (where the stabilization construction naturally
lands), after restriction to 1-connected spaces up to weak equivalence. This
resolves in the affirmative the infinite case, involving stabilization and
suspension spectra, of a question/conjecture posed by Tyler Lawson on
(iterated) suspension spaces almost ten years ago. A key ingredient of our
proof, of independent interest, is a higher stabilization theorem for spaces
that provides strong estimates for the uniform cartesian-ness of certain
cubical diagrams associated to n-fold iterations of the spaces-level
stabilization map; this is the stabilization analog of Dundas' higher Hurewicz
theorem."@2016

commutativity of Lie groups in the sense of Sugawara. The second aim is to
apply this result to the $p$-local higher homotopy commutativity of gauge
groups. Although the higher homotopy commutativity of Lie groups in the sense
of Williams is already known, the higher homotopy commutativity in the sense of
Sugawara is necessary for this application. The third aim is to resolve the
$5$-local higher homotopy non-commutativity problem of the exceptional Lie
group $\mathrm{G}_2$, which has been open for a long time."@2016

  version of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann Theorem"@['Desamparados Fernández-Ternero', 'Enrique Macías-Virgós', 'Nicholas A. Scoville', 'José Antonio Vilches']@"We prove a discrete version of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem for
discrete Morse functions and the recently introduced simplicial
Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a simplicial complex. To accomplish this, a
new notion of critical object of a discrete Morse function is presented, which
generalizes the usual concept of critical simplex (in the sense of R. Forman).
We show that the non-existence of such critical objects guarantees the strong
homotopy equivalence (in the Barmak and Minian's sense) between the
corresponding sublevel complexes. Finally, we establish that the number of
critical objects of a discrete Morse function defined on $K$ is an upper bound
for the non-normalized simplicial Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $K$."@2016
