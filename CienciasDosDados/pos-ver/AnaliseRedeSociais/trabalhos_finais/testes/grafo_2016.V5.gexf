We establish a bijection of&#10;$K$-points between the moduli and the algebraic mapping stack of regular&#10;morphisms $\mathcal{L}_{1,12n} \cong \mathrm{Hom}_n(\mathbb{P}^{1},&#10;\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1})$ where $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}$ is the&#10;Deligne-Mumford stack of stable elliptic curves and $K$ is any field of&#10;characteristic $\neq 2,3$. We show that the motive count $\mathbb{L} :=&#10;[\mathbb{A}^1] \in {K}_0( {\mathrm Var}_K)$ for the coarse moduli space $L_{1,&#10;12n}$ of $\mathcal{L}_{1,12n}$ is $[L_{1, 12n}] = \mathbb{L}^{10n +&#10;1}-\mathbb{L}^{10n - 1}$ which implies that the cardinality of the set of&#10;$\mathbb{F}_q$-points is $|L_{1, 12n}(\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{10n + 1}-q^{10n -&#10;1}$. In the end, we pass the acquired arithmetic invariant through the global&#10;fields analogy which renders a conjectural asymptotic of $Z_{\mathbb{Q}}(B)&#10;\sim \mathcal{O}\left(B^{\frac{5}{6}}\right)$ for counting semistable elliptic&#10;curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ by the bounded height of discriminant $\Delta$." />

On the category $R(X)$ of&#10;retractive spaces over a $G$-space $X$, this produces an equivariant lift of&#10;Waldhausen's functor $A(X)$, and we show that the $H$-fixed points are the&#10;bivariant $A$-theory of the fibration $X_{hH}\to BH$. We then use the framework&#10;of spectral Mackey functors to produce a second equivariant refinement $A_G(X)$&#10;whose fixed points have tom Dieck type splittings.

This resolves a lingering&#10;foundational question about the transfer, which was originally defined in the&#10;late 1970s in order to simplify the proof of the Adams conjecture. Our approach&#10;differs from previous attempts in that we closely emulate the geometric&#10;argument in the case of a smooth fiber bundle. This leads to a&#10;&quot;multiplicative'&quot; description of the transfer, different from the standard&#10;presentation as the trace of a diagonal map." />

In the case where $E \rightarrow B$ is a smooth&#10;fiber bundle, we also give a concrete geometric model for the free loop&#10;transfer in terms of Pontryagin-Thom collapse maps. We recover the previously&#10;known computations of the free loop transfer due to Schlichtkrull, and make a&#10;few new computations as well." />

This provides an abstract framework that makes certain&#10;analogies between classical and functor calculus explicit. Inspired by Huang,&#10;Marcantognini, and Young's chain rule for higher order directional derivatives&#10;of functions, we define a higher order directional derivative for functors of&#10;abelian categories. We show that our higher order directional derivative is&#10;related to the iterated partial directional derivatives of the second author&#10;and McCarthy by a Fa\`a di Bruno style formula. We obtain a higher order chain&#10;rule for our directional derivatives using a feature of the cartesian&#10;differential category structure, and with this provide a formulation for the&#10;$n$th layers of the Taylor tower of a composition of functors $F\circ G$ in&#10;terms of the derivatives and directional derivatives of $F$ and $G$,&#10;reminiscent of similar formulations for functors of spaces or spectra by Arone&#10;and Ching.

As a consequence, we describe the&#10;centraliser of such an isometry in a systolic group. Using these results, we&#10;construct a low-dimensional classifying space for the family of virtually&#10;cyclic subgroups of a group acting properly on a systolic complex. Its&#10;dimension coincides with the topological dimension of the complex if the latter&#10;is at least four. We show that graphical small cancellation complexes are&#10;classifying spaces for proper actions and that the groups acting on them&#10;properly admit three-dimensional classifying spaces with virtually cyclic&#10;stabilisers. This is achieved by constructing a systolic complex equivariantly&#10;homotopy equivalent to a graphical small cancellation complex. On the way we&#10;develop a systematic approach to graphical small cancellation complexes.&#10;Finally, we construct low-dimensional models for the family of virtually&#10;abelian subgroups for systolic, graphical small cancellation, and some CAT(0)&#10;groups." />

Additionally, (co)sheaves have proven to be powerful instruments in&#10;tracking locally defined data across global systems, resulting in innovative&#10;applications to network science. In this paper, we combine the topological&#10;results of persistent homology and the quantitative data tracking capabilities&#10;of cosheaf theory to develop novel techniques in network data flow analysis.&#10;Specifically, we use cosheaf theory to construct persistent homology in a&#10;framework geared towards assessing data flow stability in hierarchical&#10;recurrent networks (HRNs). We use cosheaves to link topological information&#10;about a filtered network encoded in persistence diagrams with data associated&#10;locally to the network. From this construction, we use the homology of&#10;cosheaves as a framework to study the notion of &quot;persistent data flow errors.&quot;&#10;That is, we generalize aspects of persistent homology to analyze the lifetime&#10;of local data flow malfunctions. We study an algorithmic construction of&#10;persistence diagrams parameterizing network data flow errors, thus enabling&#10;novel applications of statistical methods to study data flow malfunctions. We&#10;conclude with an application to network packet delivery systems." />

Moreover, a 2012 example due to Ermotti, Hongler and Weber shows that&#10;this is not true for general amphicheiral knots. On the other hand, in 2006 the&#10;first author made a conjecture equivalent to saying that the Conway polynomial&#10;of all amphicheiral knots splits as $\phi(z)\phi(-z)$ in the ring $\mathbb&#10;Z_4[z]$. In this paper, we establish this conjecture for all periodically&#10;amphicheiral knots built from braids, where the period preserves the braid&#10;structure. We also give counterexamples to conjectures on the leading&#10;coefficient of the Conway polynomial of an amphicheiral knot due to Stoimenow." />

Even more is true, the quotient is actually already an operad up to&#10;homotopy, which induces the operad structure on cellular chains adapted to&#10;prove Deligne's conjecture, while no such structure is known on Milgram's&#10;space. We show, explicitely, that these two quotients are homotopy equivalent.&#10;This gives a new topological proof that operads of this type are indeed of the&#10;right homotopy type. It also furnishes a very nice clean description in terms&#10;of polyhedra, and with it PL topology, for the whole story. The permutahedra&#10;and partial orders play a central role. This, in turn, provides direct links to&#10;other fields of mathematics.

In this present paper, we demonstrate&#10;the usefulness of this approach, by introducing the concept of decorated&#10;Feynman categories. The procedure takes a Feynman category $\mathfrak F$ and a&#10;functor $\mathcal O$ to a monoidal category to produce a new Feynman category&#10;${\mathfrak F}_{dec {\mathcal O}}$. This in one swat explains the existence of&#10;non--sigma operads, non--sigma cyclic operads, and the non--sigma--modular&#10;operads of Markl as well as all the usual candidates simply from the category&#10;$\mathfrak G$, which is a full subcategory of the category of graphs of [BM08].&#10;Moreover, we explain the appearance of terminal objects noted in [Mar15]. We&#10;can then easily extend this for instance to the dihedral case. Furthermore, we&#10;obtain graph complexes and all other known operadic type notions from&#10;decorating and restricting the basic Feynman category $\mathfrak G$ of&#10;aggregates of corollas. We additionally show that the construction is&#10;functorial. There are further geometric and number theoretic applications,&#10;which will follow in a separate preprint." />

          <attvalue for="2" value="Given a finite set in a metric space, the topological analysis generalizes&#10;hierarchical clustering using a 1-parameter family of homology groups to&#10;quantify connectivity in all dimensions. The connectivity is compactly&#10;described by the persistence diagram. One limitation of the current framework&#10;is the reliance on metric distances, whereas in many practical applications&#10;objects are compared by non-metric dissimilarity measures. Examples are the&#10;Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is commonly used for comparing text and&#10;images, and the Itakura-Saito divergence, popular for speech and sound. These&#10;are two members of the broad family of dissimilarities called Bregman&#10;divergences.&#10;  We show that the framework of topological data analysis can be extended to&#10;general Bregman divergences, widening the scope of possible applications. In&#10;particular, we prove that appropriately generalized Cech and Delaunay (alpha)&#10;complexes capture the correct homotopy type, namely that of the corresponding&#10;union of Bregman balls. Consequently, their filtrations give the correct&#10;persistence diagram, namely the one generated by the uniformly growing Bregman&#10;balls. Moreover, we show that unlike the metric setting, the filtration of&#10;Vietoris-Rips complexes may fail to approximate the persistence diagram. We&#10;propose algorithms to compute the thus generalized Cech, Vietoris-Rips and&#10;Delaunay complexes and experimentally test their efficiency. Lastly, we explain&#10;their surprisingly good performance by making a connection with discrete Morse&#10;theory." />

          <attvalue for="2" value="We generalize the first author's construction of intersection spaces to the&#10;case of stratified pseudomanifolds of stratification depth 1 with twisted link&#10;bundles, assuming that each link possesses an equivariant Moore approximation&#10;for a suitable choice of structure group. As a by-product, we find new&#10;characteristic classes for fiber bundles admitting such approximations. For&#10;trivial bundles and flat bundles whose base has finite fundamental group these&#10;classes vanish. For oriented closed pseudomanifolds, we prove that the reduced&#10;rational cohomology of the intersection spaces satisfies global Poincar\'e&#10;duality across complementary perversities if the characteristic classes vanish.&#10;The signature of the intersection spaces agrees with the Novikov signature of&#10;the top stratum. As an application, these methods yield new results about the&#10;Goresky-MacPherson intersection homology signature of pseudomanifolds. We&#10;discuss several nontrivial examples, such as the case of flat bundles and&#10;symplectic toric manifolds." />

In Part I we classified the quotient of&#10;this action. The main novelty of this paper is the description of this action&#10;for $H_1\ne0$, with an indeterminancy.&#10;  Besides the invariants of Part I, the classification involves a refinement of&#10;the Kreck invariant from our work of 2008 which detects the action of knots.&#10;  For $N=S^1\times S^3$ we give a geometrically defined 1--1 correspondence&#10;between the set of isotopy classes of embeddings and a quotient of the set&#10;$Z\oplus Z\oplus Z_{12}$." />

Our description is in&#10;terms of generators and relations, and our methods entail ideas that have&#10;appeared in the literature of quantum chemistry, theoretical physics, and&#10;combinatorics. We deal first with the case $KP^\infty$, and proceed by&#10;identifying the truncation required for passage to finite n. The calculations&#10;rely upon a ladder of long exact cohomology sequences, which arises by&#10;comparing cofibrations associated to the diagonals of the symmetric square and&#10;the corresponding Borel construction. The cofibrations involve classic&#10;configuration spaces of unordered pairs of 1-dimensional subspaces of&#10;$K^{n+1}$, and their one-point compactifications; the latter are identified as&#10;Thom spaces by combining Lowdin's symmetric orthogonalisation process (and its&#10;quaternionic extension) with a dash of Pin geometry. The ensuing integral&#10;cohomology rings may be conveniently expressed using generalised Fibonacci&#10;polynomials. By way of validation, we note that our conclusions are compatible&#10;with mod 2 computations of Nakaoka and with homological results of Milgram." />

We prove that $L$ has a classifying space for&#10;proper actions $\underline{E} L$ which is a complex of dimension two. We use&#10;this to give an explicit proof of the Baum-Connes conjecture (without&#10;coefficients), that states that the assembly map $\mu_i^L:K_i^L(\underline{E}&#10;L)\rightarrow K_i(C^*L)\;(i=0,1)$ is an isomorphism. Actually, $K_0(C^*L)$ is&#10;free abelian of countable rank, with an explicit basis consisting of&#10;projections in $C^*L$, while $K_1(C^*L)$ is infinite cyclic, generated by the&#10;unitary of $C^*L$ implementing the shift. Finally we show that, for $F$&#10;abelian, the $C^*$-algebra $C^*L$ is completely characterized by $|F|$ up to&#10;isomorphism." />

A&#10;barcode is simply a multiset of real intervals. Recent work of Edelsbrunner,&#10;Jablonski, and Mrozek suggests an equivalent description of barcodes as&#10;functors R -&gt; Mch, where R is the poset category of real numbers and Mch is the&#10;category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are matchings (i.e.,&#10;partial injective functions). Such functors form a category Mch^R whose&#10;morphisms are the natural transformations. Thus, this interpretation of&#10;barcodes gives us a hitherto unstudied categorical structure on barcodes. The&#10;aim of this note is to show that this categorical structure leads to&#10;surprisingly simple reformulations of both the well-known stability theorem for&#10;persistent homology and a recent generalization called the induced matching&#10;theorem." />

While rarely mentioned, this fundamental&#10;assumption inherently limits the types of neural structure and function that&#10;graphs can be used to model. Here, we describe a generalization of graphs that&#10;overcomes these limitations, thereby offering a broad range of new&#10;possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena.&#10;Specifically, we explore the use of \emph{simplicial complexes}, a theoretical&#10;notion developed in the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, which&#10;is now becoming applicable to real data due to a rapidly growing computational&#10;toolset. We review the underlying mathematical formalism as well as the budding&#10;literature applying simplicial complexes to neural data, from&#10;electrophysiological recordings in animal models to hemodynamic fluctuations in&#10;humans. Based on the exceptional flexibility of the tools and recent&#10;ground-breaking insights into neural function, we posit that this framework has&#10;the potential to eclipse graph theory in unraveling the fundamental mysteries&#10;of cognition." />

The purpose of this paper is to serve as a companion&#10;to the papers above, proving results which say that if a certain property or&#10;structure exists in the weak cofibration category, then the same property or&#10;structure also holds in the induced model structure on the ind-category.&#10;Namely, we consider the property of being left proper and the structures of a&#10;monoidal category and a category tensored over a monoidal category (in a way&#10;that is compatible with the weak cofibration structure).

A metric is estimated over&#10;the encounter graph of the agents in order to construct a geometric point cloud&#10;using manifold learning techniques. Topological data analysis (TDA), in&#10;particular persistent homology, is used in order to extract topological&#10;features of the space and a classification method is proposed to infer robust&#10;features of interest (e.g. existence of obstacles). We examine the asymptotic&#10;behavior of the proposed metric in terms of the convergence to the geodesic&#10;distances in the underlying manifold of the domain, and provide stability&#10;analysis results for the topological persistence. The proposed framework and&#10;its convergences and stability analysis are demonstrated through numerical&#10;simulations and experiments." />

In this paper, we&#10;propose a new version of Morita's 1-cocycle based on a simple and explicit&#10;construction. Our 1-cocycle is proved to satisfy several fundamental&#10;properties, including a connection with the Magnus representation and the LMO&#10;homomorphism. As an application, we show that the rational abelianization of&#10;the group of homology cobordisms is non-trivial.

In the course of the proof we establish some additional&#10;results: we give a new characterization of the integral homology of the complex&#10;of injective words, and we give a new proof of integral representation&#10;stability for configuration spaces of noncompact manifolds, extending previous&#10;results to nonorientable manifolds.

          <attvalue for="2" value="For a &quot;genuine&quot; equivariant commutative ring spectrum $R$, $\pi_0(R)$ admits&#10;a rich algebraic structure known as a Tambara functor. This algebraic structure&#10;mirrors the structure on $R$ arising from the existence of multiplicative norm&#10;maps. Motivated by the surprising fact that Bousfield localization can destroy&#10;some of the norm maps, in previous work we studied equivariant commutative ring&#10;structures parametrized by $N_\infty$ operads. In a precise sense, these&#10;interpolate between &quot;naive&quot; and &quot;genuine&quot; equivariant ring structures.&#10;  In this paper, we describe the algebraic analogue of $N_\infty$ ring&#10;structures. We introduce and study categories of incomplete Tambara functors,&#10;described in terms of certain categories of bispans. Incomplete Tambara&#10;functors arise as $\pi_0$ of $N_\infty$ algebras, and interpolate between Green&#10;functors and Tambara functors. We classify all incomplete Tambara functors in&#10;terms of a basic structural result about polynomial functors. This&#10;classification gives a conceptual justification for our prior description of&#10;$N_\infty$ operads and also allows us to easily describe the properties of the&#10;category of incomplete Tambara functors." />

The proposed kernel&#10;satisfies the stability property and provides explicit control on the effect of&#10;persistence. Furthermore, the method allows a fast approximation technique.

Our main interest lies in a&#10;natural `discretization' $C_\infty$ quasi-isomorphism $\varphi$ from&#10;differential forms to Whitney forms. We establish a uniqueness result that&#10;implies that $\varphi$ coincides with the morphism from homotopy transfer, and&#10;obtain several explicit formulas for $\varphi$, all of which are related to the&#10;Magnus expansion.

This allows&#10;us to calculate many examples. For example, we find that the algebraic Azumaya&#10;algebras over Lubin-Tate spectra have either 4 or 2 Morita equivalence classes&#10;depending on whether the prime is odd or even, that all algebraic Azumaya&#10;algebras over the complex K-theory spectrum $KU$ are Morita trivial, and that&#10;the group of the Morita classes of algebraic Azumaya algebras over the&#10;localization $KU[1/2]$ is $\Bbb Z/8 \times \Bbb Z/2$.&#10;  Using our descent results and an obstruction theory spectral sequence, we&#10;also study Azumaya algebras over the real K-theory spectrum $KO$ which become&#10;Morita-trivial $KU$-algebras.

          <attvalue for="2" value="The main aim of this article is to study the topology of real Bott towers as&#10;special and interesting examples of real toric varieties. We first give a&#10;presentation of the fundamental group of a real Bott tower and show that the&#10;fundamental group is abelian if and only if the real Bott tower is a product of&#10;circles. We further prove that the fundamental group of a real Bott tower is&#10;always solvable and it is nilpotent if and only if it is abelian. We then&#10;describe the cohomology ring of a real Bott tower and also give recursive&#10;formulae for the Steifel Whitney classes. We derive combinatorial&#10;characterization for orientability of these manifolds and further give a&#10;combinatorial formula for the $(n-1)$th Steifel Whitney class. In particular,&#10;we show that if a Bott tower is orientable then the $(n-1)$th Steifel Whitney&#10;class must also vanish. Moreover, by deriving a combinatorial formula for the&#10;second Steifel-Whitney class we give a necessary and sufficient condition for&#10;the Bott tower to admit a spin structure. We finally prove the vanishing of all&#10;the Steifel-Whitney numbers and hence establish that these manifolds are&#10;null-cobordant." />

This resolves in the affirmative a&#10;conjecture of Lawson on iterated suspension spaces; that homotopical descent&#10;for iterated suspension is satisfied on objects and morphisms---the&#10;corresponding iterated desuspension space can be built as the homotopy limit of&#10;a cosimplicial cobar construction encoding the homotopical coalgebraic&#10;structure. It also provides a homotopical recognition principle for iterated&#10;suspension spaces.

          <attvalue for="2" value="Geometric, topological and graph theory modeling and analysis of biomolecules&#10;are of essential importance in the conceptualization of molecular structure,&#10;function, dynamics, and transport. On the one hand, geometric modeling provides&#10;molecular surface and structural representation, and offers the basis for&#10;molecular visualization, which is crucial for the understanding of molecular&#10;structure and interactions. On the other hand, it bridges the gap between&#10;molecular structural data and theoretical/mathematical models. Topological&#10;analysis and modeling give rise to atomic critical points and connectivity, and&#10;shed light on the intrinsic topological invariants such as independent&#10;components (atoms), rings (pockets) and cavities. Graph theory analyzes&#10;biomolecular interactions and reveals biomolecular structure-function&#10;relationship. In this paper, we review certain geometric, topological and graph&#10;theory apparatuses for biomolecular data modeling and analysis. These&#10;apparatuses are categorized into discrete and continuous ones. For discrete&#10;approaches, graph theory, Gaussian network model, anisotropic network model,&#10;normal mode analysis, quasi-harmonic analysis, flexibility and rigidity index,&#10;molecular nonlinear dynamics, spectral graph theory, and persistent homology&#10;are discussed. For continuous mathematical tools, we present discrete to&#10;continuum mapping, high dimensional persistent homology, biomolecular geometric&#10;modeling, differential geometry theory of surfaces, curvature evaluation,&#10;variational derivation of minimal molecular surfaces, atoms in molecule theory&#10;and quantum chemical topology. Four new approaches, including analytical&#10;minimal molecular surface, Hessian matrix eigenvalue map, curvature map and&#10;virtual particle model, are introduced for the first time to bridge the gaps in&#10;biomolecular modeling and analysis." />

As a consequence, the&#10;Kervaire invariant element $\theta_5$ is contained in the strictly defined&#10;4-fold Toda bracket $\langle 2, \theta_4, \theta_4, 2\rangle$.&#10;  Our result has a geometric corollary: the 61-sphere has a unique smooth&#10;structure and it is the last odd dimensional case - the only ones are $S^1,&#10;S^3, S^5$ and $S^{61}$.&#10;  Our proof is a computation of homotopy groups of spheres. A major part of&#10;this paper is to prove an Adams differential $d_3(D_3) = B_3$. We prove this&#10;differential by introducing a new technique based on the algebraic and&#10;geometric Kahn-Priddy theorems. The success of this technique suggests a&#10;theoretical way to prove Adams differentials in the sphere spectrum inductively&#10;by use of differentials in truncated projective spectra." />

Our main result is&#10;that both families are cohomologically rigid, i.e. two manifolds M and M' from&#10;either of the families are diffeomorphic if and only if their cohomology rings&#10;are isomorphic. We also prove that if M and M' are diffeomorphic, then their&#10;corresponding polytopes are combinatorially equivalent. These results are&#10;intertwined with the classical subjects of geometry and topology, such as&#10;combinatorics of 3-polytopes, the Four Colour Theorem, aspherical manifolds,&#10;diffeomorphism classification of 6-manifolds and invariance of Pontryagin&#10;classes. The proofs use techniques of toric topology." />

As a consequence, we recover, in a&#10;unified and conceptual way, the original results of Vistoli concerning&#10;algebraic K-theory, of Baranovsky concerning cyclic homology, of the second&#10;author with Polishchuk concerning Hochschild homology, and of Baranovsky-Petrov&#10;and Caldararu-Arinkin (unpublished) concerning twisted Hochschild homology; in&#10;the case of topological Hochschild homology and periodic topological cyclic&#10;homology, the aforementioned computation is new in the literature. As an&#10;application, we verify Grothendieck's standard conjectures of type C and D, as&#10;well as Voevodsky's smash-nilpotence conjecture, in the case of&#10;&quot;low-dimensional&quot; orbifolds.

If a normal space X is the union of a sequence of open subsets {&#10;U(n) } such that the closure of U(n) is contained in U(n+1) and U(n) contracts&#10;to a point in U(n+1) for each n &gt; 0, then X is contractible.&#10;  COROLLARY 2.

Such manifolds have the same dimension&#10;and the same volume, and their rational homology groups are isomorphic. We&#10;investigate the relationship between their integral homology. The&#10;Cheeger-Mueller Theorem implies that a certain product of orders of torsion&#10;homology and of regulators for M_1 agrees with that for M_2. We exhibit a&#10;connection between the torsion in the integral homology of M_1 and M_2 on the&#10;one hand, and the G-module structure of integral homology of the covering&#10;manifold on the other, by interpreting the quotients Reg_i(M_1)/Reg_i(M_2)&#10;representation theoretically. Further, we prove that the p-primary torsion in&#10;the homology of M_1 is isomorphic to that of M_2 for all primes p not dividing&#10;#G. For p &lt;= 71, we give examples of pairs of isospectral hyperbolic&#10;3-manifolds for which the p-torsion homology differs, and we conjecture such&#10;examples to exist for all primes p." />

For this, we construct a conservative and fully&#10;faithful $\infty$-functor from pointed conilpotent homotopy bialgebras to&#10;augmented $E_2$-algebras which consists in an appropriate &quot;cobar&quot; construction.&#10;Then we prove that the (derived) formal moduli problem of homotopy bialgebras&#10;structures on a bialgebra is equivalent to the (derived) formal moduli problem&#10;of $E_2$-algebra structures on this &quot;cobar&quot; construction. We show consequently&#10;that the $E_3$-algebra structure on the higher Hochschild complex of this cobar&#10;construction, given by the solution to the higher Deligne conjecture, controls&#10;the deformation theory of this bialgebra. This implies the existence of an&#10;$E_3$-structure on the deformation complex of a dg bialgebra, solving a&#10;long-standing conjecture of Gerstenhaber-Schack. On this basis we solve a&#10;long-standing conjecture of Kontsevich, by proving the $E_3$-formality of the&#10;deformation complex of the symmetric bialgebra. This provides as a corollary a&#10;new proof of Etingof-Kazdhan deformation quantization of Lie bialgebras which&#10;extends to homotopy dg Lie bialgebras and is independent from the choice of an&#10;associator.

Using &quot;negative posets&quot;, we establish Stanley's&#10;reciprocity theorems for order polynomials at the level of Euler&#10;characteristics. We also formulate the Euler characteristic reciprocities for&#10;chromatic and flow polynomials." />

In this paper we&#10;prove a relative version of Deligne's conjecture. In other words, we show that&#10;the deformation complex of a homotopy affine action has the structure of an&#10;algebra over an ${\rm SC}_2$ operad.

          <attvalue for="2" value="The filtered derived category of an abelian category has played a useful role&#10;in subjects including geometric representation theory, mixed Hodge modules, and&#10;the theory of motives. We develop a natural generalization using current&#10;methods of homotopical algebra, in the formalisms of stable&#10;infinity-categories, stable model categories, and pretriangulated,&#10;idempotent-complete dg categories. We characterize the filtered stable&#10;infinity-category Fil(C) of a stable infinity-category C as the left exact&#10;localization of sequences in C along the infinity-categorical version of&#10;completion (and prove analogous model and dg category statements). We also&#10;spell out how these constructions interact with spectral sequences and monoidal&#10;structures. As examples of this machinery, we construct a stable model category&#10;of filtered D-modules and develop the rudiments of a theory of filtered operads&#10;and filtered algebras over operads." />

We give a thorough analysis of the gap between such estimates when&#10;$X=RP^m$, the real projective space of dimension $m.$ In particular, we&#10;describe a number $r(m)$, which depends on the structure of zeros and ones in&#10;the binary expansion of $m$, and with the property that $TC_s(RP^m)$ is given&#10;by $sm$ with an error of at most one provided $s \geq r(m)$ and $m \not\equiv 3&#10;\bmod 4$ (the error vanishes for even $m$). The latter fact appears to be&#10;closely related to the estimation of the Euclidean immersion dimension of&#10;$RP^m$. We illustrate the phenomenon in the case $m=3 \cdot 2^a$." />

          <attvalue for="2" value="We prove the following generalization of a classical result of Adams: for any&#10;pointed and connected topological space $(X,b)$, that is not necessarily simply&#10;connected, the cobar construction of the differential graded (dg) coalgebra of&#10;normalized singular chains in $X$ with vertices at $b$ is weakly equivalent as&#10;a differential graded associative algebra (dga) to the singular chains on the&#10;Moore based loop space of $X$ at $b$. We deduce this statement from several&#10;more general categorical results of independent interest. We construct a&#10;functor $\mathfrak{C}_{\square_c}$ from simplicial sets to categories enriched&#10;over cubical sets with connections which, after triangulation of their mapping&#10;spaces, coincides with Lurie's rigidification functor $\mathfrak{C}$ from&#10;simplicial sets to simplicial categories. Taking normalized chains of the&#10;mapping spaces of $\mathfrak{C}_{\square_c}$ yields a functor $\Lambda$ from&#10;simplicial sets to dg categories which is the left adjoint to the dg nerve&#10;functor. For any simplicial set $S$ with $S_0=\{x\}$, $\Lambda(S)(x,x)$ is a&#10;dga isomorphic to $\Omega Q_{\Delta}(S)$, the cobar construction on the dg&#10;coalgebra $Q_{\Delta}(S)$ of normalized chains on $S$. We use these facts to&#10;show that $Q_{\Delta}$ sends categorical equivalences between simplicial sets&#10;to maps of connected dg coalgebras which induce quasi-isomorphisms of dga's&#10;under the cobar functor." />

          <attvalue for="2" value="Lie $\infty$-groupoids are simplicial Banach manifolds that satisfy an analog&#10;of the Kan condition for simplicial sets. An explicit construction of Henriques&#10;produces certain Lie $\infty$-groupoids called `Lie $\infty$-groups' by&#10;integrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility&#10;between this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras&#10;introduced in the companion paper arXiv:1809.05999, we present a homotopy&#10;theory for Lie $\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher&#10;geometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\infty$-groupoids do not form&#10;a category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks&#10;pullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete&#10;category of fibrant objects' in which the weak equivalences correspond to&#10;`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure&#10;enjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of&#10;functorial path objects, a convenient realization of its simplicial&#10;localization. We further prove that the acyclic fibrations are precisely the&#10;hypercovers, which implies that many of Behrend and Getzler's results also hold&#10;in this more general context. As an application, we show that Henriques'&#10;integration functor is an exact functor with respect to a class of&#10;distinguished fibrations which we call `quasi-split fibrations'. Such&#10;fibrations include acyclic fibrations as well as fibrations that arise in&#10;string-like extensions. In particular, integration sends $L_\infty$&#10;quasi-isomorphisms to weak equivalences, quasi-split fibrations to Kan&#10;fibrations, and preserves acyclic fibrations, as well as pullbacks of&#10;acyclic/quasi-split fibrations." />

          <attvalue for="2" value="If O is a reduced operad in symmetric spectra, an O-algebra I can be viewed&#10;as analogous to the augmentation ideal of an augmented algebra. Implicit in the&#10;literature on Topological Andre-Quillen homology is that such an I admits a&#10;canonical (and homotopically meaningful) decreasing O-algebra filtration I &gt;&#10;I^2 &gt; I^3 &gt; ... satisfying various nice properties analogous to powers of an&#10;ideal in a ring.&#10;  In this paper, we are explicit about these constructions. With R a&#10;commutative S-algebra, we study derived versions of the circle product M o_O I,&#10;where M is an O-bimodule, and I is an O-algebra in R-modules. Letting M run&#10;through a decreasing O-bimodule filtration of O itself then yields the&#10;augmentation ideal filtration as above. The composition structure of the operad&#10;induces algebra maps from (I^i)^j to I^{ij}, fitting nicely with previously&#10;studied structure.&#10;  As a formal consequence, an O-algebra map from I to J^d induces compatible&#10;maps from I^n to J^{dn}, for all n. This is an essential tool in the first&#10;author's study of Hurewicz maps for infinite loop spaces, and its utility is&#10;illustrated here with a lifting theorem." />

          <attvalue for="2" value="The aim of this paper is to develop a refinement of Forman's discrete Morse&#10;theory. To an acyclic partial matching $\mu$ on a finite regular CW complex&#10;$X$, Forman introduced a discrete analogue of gradient flows. Although Forman's&#10;gradient flow has been proved to be useful in practical computations of&#10;homology groups, it is not sufficient to recover the homotopy type of $X$.&#10;Forman also proved the existence of a CW complex which is homotopy equivalent&#10;to $X$ and whose cells are in one-to-one correspondence with the critical cells&#10;of $\mu$, but the construction is ad hoc and does not have a combinatorial&#10;description. By relaxing the definition of Forman's gradient flows, we&#10;introduce the notion of flow paths, which contains enough information to&#10;reconstruct the homotopy type of $X$, while retaining a combinatorial&#10;description. The critical difference from Forman's gradient flows is the&#10;existence of a partial order on the set of flow paths, from which a&#10;$2$-category $C(\mu)$ is constructed. It is shown that the classifying space of&#10;$C(\mu)$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$ by using homotopy theory of&#10;$2$-categories. This result can be also regarded as a discrete analogue of the&#10;unpublished work of Cohen, Jones, and Segal on Morse theory in early 90's." />

          <attvalue for="2" value="We characterize the class of persistence modules indexed over $\mathbb{R}^2$&#10;that are decomposable into summands whose support have the shape of a {\em&#10;block}---i.e. a horizontal band, a vertical band, an upper-right quadrant, or a&#10;lower-left quadrant. Assuming the modules are pointwise finite dimensional&#10;(pfd), we show that they are decomposable into block summands if and only if&#10;they satisfy a certain local property called {\em exactness}. Our proof follows&#10;the same scheme as the proof of decomposition for pfd persistence modules&#10;indexed over $\mathbb{R}$, yet it departs from it at key stages due to the&#10;product order on $\mathbb{R}^2$ not being a total order, which leaves some&#10;important gaps open. These gaps are filled in using more direct arguments. Our&#10;work is motivated primarily by the stability theory for zigzags and&#10;interlevel-sets persistence modules, in which block-decomposable bimodules play&#10;a key part. Our results allow us to drop some of the conditions under which&#10;that theory holds, in particular the Morse-type conditions." />

In particular, the&#10;diffeomorphism type of the complement manifold and the Milnor fiber and&#10;fibration of these arrangements are combinatorially determined, i.e., they&#10;depend uniquely on the underlying matroid.

The stable ${\mathbb Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy class&#10;of $h(F)$ is the primary obstruction to desuspending $F$ up to homotopy. The&#10;explicit nature of the construction allows for a $\pi$-equivariant version of&#10;$h(F)$ in the case of a $\pi$-equivariant $F$, with $\pi$ a discrete group. In&#10;earlier joint work we applied the $\pi_1(N)$-equivariant geometric Hopf&#10;invariant of the Umkehr map $F:\Sigma^{\infty}N^+ \to \Sigma^{\infty}T(\nu_f)$&#10;of an immersion $f:M \to N$ to capture the double points of $f$ in ${\mathbb&#10;Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory. In this manuscript we use the&#10;$\pi$-equivariant geometric Hopf invariant $h(F)$ to unify all the previous&#10;homotopy theoretic treatments of double points. Furthermore, $h(F)$ is combined&#10;with the second author's algebraic surgery theory of chain complexes with&#10;Poincar\'e duality to provide the homotopy theoretic foundations for&#10;non-simply-connected geometric surgery. For an $n$-dimensional normal map&#10;$(f,b):M \to X$ the $\pi_1(X)$-equivariant geometric Hopf invariant $h(F)$ of&#10;the Umkehr map $F:\Sigma^{\infty}X^+ \to\Sigma^{\infty}M^+$ is shown to induce&#10;the $\pi_1(X)$-equivariant quadratic structure $\psi_F$ on the chain complex&#10;kernel $C$ of $(f,b)$. Previously $\psi_F$ had only been constructed using the&#10;chain complex analogue of the functional Steenrod squares. The Wall surgery&#10;obstruction $\sigma_*(f,b)=(C,\psi_F) \in L_n({\mathbb Z}[\pi_1(X)])$ is the&#10;cobordism class of the corresponding $n$-dimensional quadratic Poincar\'e&#10;complex $(C,\psi_F)$, as in the original theory." />

This spectrum has stable homotopy groups concentrated in levels&#10;0, 1, and 2. In this paper, we describe part of the Postnikov data of&#10;$K\mathcal{D}$ in terms of categorical structure. We use this to show that&#10;there is no strict skeletal Picard 2-category whose $K$-theory realizes the&#10;2-truncation of the sphere spectrum. As part of the proof, we construct a&#10;categorical suspension, producing a Picard 2-category $\Sigma C$ from a Picard&#10;1-category $C$, and show that it commutes with $K$-theory in that $K\Sigma C$&#10;is stably equivalent to $\Sigma K C$." />
