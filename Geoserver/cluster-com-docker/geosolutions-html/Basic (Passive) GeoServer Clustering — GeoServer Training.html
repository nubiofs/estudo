<p>The objective of this document is to provide suggestions about how to
 best exploit the HW resources required with respect to the various 
software components of interests, namely, Apache Tomcat, GeoServer, and 
GeoWebCache in order to, on a side, implement an High Availability set 
up for each one of them to minimize the possibility of a service 
downtime and on the other side to achieve the maximum possible 
scalability in terms of number of concurrent requests that can be served
 for the unit of time with an acceptable response time. In the remaining
 part of this document we will assume that the reader possesses a decent
 knowledge of what the various software components do as well as the 
protocols they support. We will delve only into specifics related to the
 topic being discussed, that is properly dimensioning the deployment. In
 order to obtain reproducible numbers for the dimensioning of a host for
 GeoServer/GeoWebcache and Apache Tomcat capable to serve a certain 
number of concurrent requests, we have set-up a
test environment and launched different stress-test against it, in order
 to test its limits.</p>

<h2>Highly Available (HA) set up for GeoServer<a class="headerlink" href="#highly-available-ha-set-up-for-geoserver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Clustering GeoServer is required to implement an Highly Available set
 up as well as in order to achieve superior scalability. Regardless of 
the reason why one intends to create a clustered deployment for 
GeoServer there are a few limitations that must be taken into account 
and where possible worked around, let us now briefly introduce and 
discuss them.</p>

<h2>GeoServer Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#geoserver-limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="data-directory">
<h3>Data Directory<a class="headerlink" href="#data-directory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently the default persistence method for the internal 
configuration consists in a set of XML files contained inside a 
well-known directory called data directory (see the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/datadirectory/index.html">GeoServer material</a>
 for additional information). This means that whenever we change the 
internal configuration and we persist the changes such changes are 
persisted in these XML files, moreover, whenever we need to load the 
internal configuration we need to read these files.</p>
<p>GeoServer comes with a built-in data directory. However, it is a good
 idea to separate the data from the application. Using an external data 
directory allows for much easier upgrades, since there is no risk of 
configuration information being overwritten. An external data directory 
also makes it easy to transfer your configuration elsewhere if desired. 
To point to an external data directory, you only need to edit the 
web.xml file. If you are new to GeoServer, you can copy (or just move) 
the data directory that comes with GeoServer to another location.</p>
<p>Following this, it becomes obvious that if we want to cluster 
multiple instances of GeoServer we must somehow share the same data 
directory in order to make sure that all the instances are identical. 
This can be achieved by either having the multiple instances share the 
same location for the geoserver_data variable or to act at a lower level
 and use file system replication to keep different locations in synch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="internal-configuration">
<h3>Internal Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#internal-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the term GeoServer internal configuration we refer to the 
information that GeoServer manages and persists in order to perform its 
work. This information refers to, as an instance:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Where the data is located</li>
<li>How to connect to and serve such data</li>
<li>How to manage incoming requests</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. Long story short, all the information that GeoServer needs
 for its proper working are represented within the internal 
configuration therefore every time we configure a new dataset or we 
change the way we want WMS to behave we interact with the internal 
configuration.</p>
<p>GeoServer’s configuration is stored by default in the Data Directory,
 as explained above, moreover, it is worth to point out that it is 
loaded  in memory at start up and thereafter GeoServer assumes that the 
configuration resides in memory.
The infrastructure within the GeoServer codebase that manages the memory
 copy of the internal configuration is called <em>catalog</em> (which 
should not be confused with the OGC concept of catalog) and contains the
 GeoServer’s internal object model where all the information of the 
internal configuration are represented by in memory Java objects and 
relations; access to the catalog is guarded via specific locks from both
 the user interface as well as from the REST interface in order to 
ensure that proper access it it’s guaranteed in every moment.</p>
<p>It is crucial to understand that changes made to the Data Directory 
are not picked up automatically by GeoServer; an operation called <em>catalog reload</em>
 needs to be issues to make GeoServer aware of the changes and such 
operation is available both form the GUI as well as from the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/rest/api/reload.html">REST</a> interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging-configuration">
<h3>Logging Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#logging-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GeoServer’s logging subsystem is quite flexible as we can decide 
whether or not we log onto the output stream (which usually means the 
internal logging mechanism for the enclosing Application Server as well 
as the location of the specific GeoServer’s own log file where only the 
log coming from GeoServer is written.</p>
<p>By default GeoServer’s log location is relative to the data 
directory, however regardless of its location when multiple GeoServer 
share the same data directory it is crucial to instruct them to log to 
different locations, this can be achieved via the GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION
 configuration tweak as described <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/configuration/logging.html#overriding-the-log-location-setup-in-the-geoserver-configuration">here</a>.
 Setting this environmental variable to different locations for each 
GeoServer instance (i.e. Java process) allows us to properly configure 
each of them to write to a different log file avoiding any problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="java2d-rasterizer-bottleneck">
<h3>Java2D Rasterizer Bottleneck<a class="headerlink" href="#java2d-rasterizer-bottleneck" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Common Java installations come with two different rasterizers (the component that turns vector into raster images)</p>
<p>The Oracle JDK has a fast rasterizer, but one that can only 
rasterizer one shape at a time in the whole process when antialiasing is
 enabled. When generating images on server side in a concurrent 
environment, worker threads are blocked most of the times so the 
application does not scale at all. As soon as multiple clients request 
the generation of images, the response time increases.
When you have more than 4 CPU, and if you are normally CPU bound, set-up
 multiple processes and use a load balancer to distribute the load among
 them.</p>
<p>The OpenJDK rasterizer, available on Linux, scales up well instead, 
but it’s slower when a single request is hitting the server.
Generally speaking, the OpenJDK one catches up with the Oracle JDK one 
when 2-4 requests are running in parallel, and provides better 
performance from this point on.</p>
<p>A new open source rasterizer, the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bourgesl/marlin-renderer">Marlin Renderer</a>, is being worked on at GitHub, which provides best of both worlds: it is as fast, if not faster,
than the Oracle JDK on isolated requests, but scales up as well as the OpenJDK one when the load goes up.</p>

<h3>Where the data is located<a class="headerlink" href="#where-the-data-is-located" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The spatial data accessed by GeoServer doesn’t need to reside within 
the GeoServer data directory, just pointers to the data locations. This 
should be obvious for data stored in spatial databases, which are 
certainly in different locations (on disk) and often on different 
machines; however the same is true for file-based spatial data and this 
can be problematic for a clustered GeoServer instances since depending 
on the approach taken for clustering such instances we need to ensure 
that both the data directory as well as the data it points to are mapped
 in a proper way on the machines for the various instances.</p>

<div class="section" id="integrated-geowebcache-configuration">
<h3>Integrated GeoWebCache Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#integrated-geowebcache-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Standard GeoServer comes with an integrated GeoWebCache instance to 
achieve map acceleration for tile based requests without the need for 
installing an additional piece of software. This capability is very good
 for small set up but might need special attention/configuration in 
clustered setups.</p>

<h3>Residual limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#residual-limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once all of the above configuration changes are completed the cluster
 is ready for production. If nothing in the configuration ever changes, 
or changes only rarely, we’ve got a good production environment.</p>

<h1>Backoffice/Production configuration (separate Data Directory)<a class="headerlink" href="#backoffice-production-configuration-separate-data-directory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When a cluster of GeoServer with shared data directory is configured 
it’s advisable to setup an offline GeoServer working off a copy of the 
cluster data directory (staging area), make changes until a new 
satisfactory configuration layout is reached, and then propagate the 
changes to the production cluster with the following steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Copy the data directory from the staging area to the production one</li>
<li>Issue the “reload” REST configuration command on each node in the cluster so that the new configuration gets loaded on disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach starts showing its limitations when any of the following situations apply:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Frequent configuration changes that need to be applied right away to the entire cluster</li>
<li>The configuration contains many layers (hundreds or more) which 
implies a long reload time. During the reload phase the server is not 
really able to respond properly to OGC requests as the configuration is 
in an inconsistent and incomplete state</li>
</ul>

<h1>Master/Slave cluster with shared Data Directory<a class="headerlink" href="#master-slave-cluster-with-shared-data-directory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To understand how a cluster of GeoServer with shared data directory 
works, we have to explain how the configuration is actually handled.</p>
<div class="section" id="in-memory-configuration">
<h2>In Memory Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#in-memory-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Besides the fact that the internal configuration for GeoServer is 
stored by default in XML files, it is worth to point out that currently 
the persistence subsystem loads thoroughly in memory at start up ( or 
reload ) the entire internal configuration as it is defined inside the 
XML files in the data directory assuming, after that time, that the 
configuration resides actually in memory.</p>
<p>The infrastructure within the GeoServer codebase that manages the in 
memory copy of the internal configuration is called catalog (which 
should not be confused with the OGC concept of catalog) and contains the
 GeoServer’s internal object model where all the information of the 
internal configuration are represented by in memory Java objects and 
relations; access to the catalog is guarded via specific locks from both
 the user interface as well as from the REST interface in order to 
ensure that proper access it it’s guaranteed in every moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performing-changes-to-the-configuration">
<h2>Performing changes to the configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#performing-changes-to-the-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Changing something into the catalog via the GUI or via the REST 
interface in this configuration is not a simple or atomic operation.
The fact that the internal catalog is kept pinned in memory by the 
GeoServer is relevant especially in a clustered environment since 
whenever a configuration change is made in one instance of GeoServer 
(the <strong>master</strong>) the other instances (the <strong>slaves</strong>)
 should not be aware of the change unless a full configuration reload is
 issued, moreover the internal configuration and catalog of GeoServer 
during a configuration reload is in an inconsistent state until when the
 loading has been performed and all the configuration objects have been 
created.</p>
<p>Along the same line it is worth to point out that when working with a
 cluster of GeoServer instances whenever we make a configuration change 
in an instance of the cluster we must reload the configuration of the 
other instances and this process becomes slower as we the configuration 
grows that is as more data is deployed.</p>
