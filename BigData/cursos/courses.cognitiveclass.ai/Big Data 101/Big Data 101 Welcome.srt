00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:04,151
- [Narrator] Hello, and welcome to Big Data University.

1
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:06,188
In this course, you will get answers

2
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:10,000
to fundamental questions such as what is Big Data?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,990
Where is Big Data coming from?

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,488
And, how can businesses derive value from it?

5
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:18,190
The syllabus goes beyond the hype of Big Data

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,905
to talk about adoption, and the skills required

7
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:24,279
for data scientists in the Big Data era.

8
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,120
We will cover the Vs that have come to define Big Data,

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,453
velocity, volume, variety, and veracity,

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:37,011
as well as the final, and perhaps most important V, value.

11
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:40,143
We will look for some use cases for Big Data, and cover

12
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:43,904
important considerations, like governance and security.

13
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:47,863
We will also provide a high-level introduction to Hadoop.

14
00:00:47,863 --> 00:00:49,708
We discuss what it is, and why

15
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,921
it is relevant to a Big Data discussion.

16
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,461
Once you have taken this course,

17
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:56,978
you will be familiar with the terminology used

18
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:59,993
in Big Data conversations, and you will have an idea

19
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:03,942
of how Big Data can be applied in different industries.

20
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:08,306
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about Big Data.

21
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:09,556
Happy learning.
