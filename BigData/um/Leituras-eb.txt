(Part I: Getting Started with Big Data)

- The Evolution of Data Management

Although data management is typically viewed through
a software lens, it actually has to be viewed from a holistic perspective. Data
management has to include technology advances in hardware, storage, net-
working, and computing models such as virtualization and cloud computing.

Big data is not a stand-alone technology; rather, it is a
combination of the last 50 years of technology evolution.

- Understanding the Waves of Managing Data

Wave 1: Creating manageable
data structures

	RDBMS; BLOBs; ODBMS

Wave 2: Web and content management

	store and manage web content, images, audio, and video.

Wave 3: Managing big data

	Many of the technologies at the heart of big data, such as virtualization,
	parallel processing, distributed file systems, and in-memory databases, have
	been around for decades.

	big data is not simply about
	one tool or one technology. It is about how all these technologies come
	together to give the right insights, at the right time, based on the right data

Big data incorpo-
rates all data, including structured data and unstructured data from e-mail,
social media, text streams, and more. This kind of data management requires
that companies leverage both their structured and unstructured data.

A big data management architecture must include a variety of services
that enable companies to make use of myriad data sources in a fast and effec-
tive manner. To help you make sense of this, we put the components into a
diagram (see Figure 1-2) that will help you see what’s there and the relation-
ship between the components.

(Figura pág 18):

	- Interfaces and feeds

		what makes big data big is the fact that it relies on picking up lots of data from lots of
		sources. Therefore, open application programming interfaces (APIs) will be
		core to any big data architecture. In addition, keep in mind that interfaces
		exist at every level and between every layer of the stack. Without integration
		services, big data can’t happen.

	- Redundant physical infrastructure

		The supporting physical infrastructure is fundamental to the operation and
		scalability of a big data architecture.

		The physical infrastructure is based on a distributed
		computing model. This means that data may be physically stored in many
		different locations and can be linked together through networks, the use of a
		distributed file system, and various big data analytic tools and applications.

		Redundancy is important because we are dealing with so much data from
		so many different sources.

		this redundancy may come in the form of a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering
		that allows companies to do sophisticated data analysis as a service.

	- Operational data sources

		operational data now has to encompass a broader set of data sources, including unstructured sources
		such as customer and social media data in all its forms.
